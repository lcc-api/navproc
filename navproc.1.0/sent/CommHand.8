0	0	10	8.6.3.1 Hospital Ships , Medical Transports , and Medical Aircraft
1	10	27	Properly designated and marked hospital ships , medical transports , and medical aircraft , as well as coastal rescue craft are exempt from destruction or capture .
2	37	25	A hospital ship ’s medical personnel and crew must not be attacked or captured even if there are no sick or wounded on board .
3	62	26	Names and descriptions of hospital ships must be provided to the parties to the conflict not later than 10 days before they are first employed .
4	88	23	Thereafter , hospital ships must be used exclusively to assist , treat , and transport the wounded , sick , and shipwrecked .
5	111	30	All exterior surfaces of hospital ships are painted white and the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross or Red Crescent is displayed on the hull and on horizontal surfaces .
6	141	27	In the actual employment of hospital ships , the application of some previously well - established principles has adapted to reflect the realities of modern circumstances .
7	168	38	Traditionally , hospital ships could not be armed , although crew members could carry light individual weapons for the maintenance of order , for their own defense and that of the wounded , sick , and shipwrecked .
8	206	92	However , due to the current threat environment in which the red cross symbol is not recognized by various hostile groups and actors as indicating protected status , the United States views the manning of hospital ships with defensive weapons systems , such as antimissile defense systems or crew - served weapons to defend against small boat threats as prudent AT / FP measures , analogous to arming crew members with small arms , and consistent with the humanitarian purpose of hospital ships and duty to safeguard the wounded and sick .
9	298	30	Additionally , weapons and ammunition taken from the wounded , sick , and shipwrecked , may also be retained on board for eventual turn - over to proper authority .
10	328	84	Further , Article 34 , Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded , Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949 , provides that hospital ships may not use or possess “ secret codes ” as means of communication so that belligerents could verify that hospital ships ’ communications systems were being used only in support of their humanitarian function and not as a means of communicating information that would be harmful to the enemy .
11	412	25	However , subsequent technological advances in encryption and satellite navigation , while recognized as legally problematic , have not been specifically addressed by treaty .
12	437	28	As a practical matter , modern navigational technology requires that the traditional rule prohibiting “ secret codes ” be understood to not include modern communications encryption systems .
13	465	20	However , such systems must not be used for military purposes in any way harmful to a potential adversary .
14	485	45	Medical aircraft , whether civilian or military , and whether permanently or temporarily so employed , must be used exclusively for the removal and transportation of the wounded , sick , and shipwrecked , or for the transportation of medical personnel or medical equipment .
15	530	10	They shall not be armed nor configured for reconnaissance .
16	540	33	Medical aircraft shall contain no armament other than small arms and ammunition belonging to the wounded and sick or necessary for the defense of the wounded and sick and the medical personnel .
17	573	33	Medical aircraft must also not be used to collect or transmit intelligence data since they must not be used to commit , outside their humanitarian duties , acts harmful to the enemy .
18	606	37	This prohibition , however , does not preclude the presence or use on board medical aircraft of communications equipment and encryption materials solely to facilitate navigation , identification , or communication in support of medical operations .
19	643	21	Medical aircraft should be clearly marked with the emblem of the Red Cross , Red Crescent , or Red Crystal .
20	664	14	Failure to so mark them risks having them not recognized as protected platforms .
21	678	35	Hospital ships , medical transports , and medical aircraft utilized solely for medical purposes and recognized as such , whether or not marked with the appropriate emblem , are not to be deliberately attacked .
22	713	36	Before making flights bringing medical aircraft within range of the enemy ’s surface - to - air weapons systems the enemy should be notified with a view to ensuring such aircraft will not be attacked .
23	749	18	Aeromedical evacuation also may , of course , be conducted by combat - equipped helicopters and airplanes .
24	767	20	They are not , however , exempt from attack , and fly at their own risk of being attacked .
25	787	14	Hospital ships can leave port even if the port falls into enemy hands .
26	801	19	Hospital ships are not classified as warships with regard to the length of their stay in neutral ports .
27	820	25	Hospital ships must not be used for any other purpose during the conflict , particularly in an attempt to shield military objectives from attack .
28	845	55	To ensure this , an opposing force may visit and search hospital ships , put on board a commissioner temporarily or put on neutral observers , detain the ship for no more than 7 days ( if required by the gravity of the circumstances ) , and control the ship ’s means of communications .
29	900	24	The opposing force may also order hospital ships to depart , make them take a certain course , or refuse assistance to them .
30	924	46	A warship may demand the surrender of enemy military wounded , sick , and shipwrecked personnel found in hospital ships and other craft provided they are in a fit state to be moved and that the warship can provide adequate facilities for necessary medical treatment .
31	970	24	Sick bays and their medical personnel aboard other naval vessels must also be respected by boarding parties and spared as much as possible .
32	994	28	They remain subject to the laws of warfare , but cannot be diverted from their medical purposes if required for the care of the wounded or sick .
33	1022	32	If a naval commander can ensure the proper care of the sick and wounded , and if there is urgent military necessity , sick bays may be used for other purposes .
34	1054	12	Medical aircraft must comply with a request to land for inspection .
35	1066	18	These requests are to be given in accordance with ICAO standard procedures for interception of civil aircraft .
36	1084	69	Medical aircraft complying with such a request to land must be allowed to continue their flight , with all personnel on board belonging to their forces , to neutral countries , or to countries not a party to the conflict , so long as inspection does not reveal that the aircraft was engaging in acts harmful to the inspecting force or otherwise violating the Geneva Conventions of 1949 .
37	1153	18	Persons of the nationality of the inspecting force found on board may be taken off and retained .
