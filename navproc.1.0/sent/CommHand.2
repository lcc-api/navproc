1	7	25	Vessels that are not legitimately registered in any one State are without nationality , and are often referred to as “ stateless vessels . ”
2	32	35	They are not entitled to fly the flag of any State and , because they are not entitled to the protection of any State , they are subject to the jurisdiction of all States .
3	67	46	U. S. case law , for instance , has expressly held that “ because stateless vessels do not fall within the veil of another sovereign ’s territorial protection , all nations can treat them as their own territory and subject them to their laws . ”
4	113	30	Accordingly , stateless vessels may be boarded upon being encountered in international waters by a warship or other government vessel , and subjected to all appropriate law enforcement actions .
5	143	16	Other conduct that could lead a vessel to be treated as one without nationality includes :
6	159	14	1 . The vessel displays no name , flag , or other identifying characteristics
7	173	22	2 . The master or person in charge , upon request , makes no claim of nationality or registry for that vessel
8	195	30	3 . The claim of registry or the vessel ’s display of registry is either denied or not affirmatively and unequivocally confirmed by the State whose registry is claimed .
