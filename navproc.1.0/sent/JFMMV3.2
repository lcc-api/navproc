1	9	41	a. VR work package screening guidelines in reference ( c ) limit the type of work which may be accomplished using overseas shipyards or Ship Repair Facilities - Japan Regional Maintenance Center ( SRF - JRMC ) to VRs only .
2	50	27	For the purpose of this prohibition , a shipyard is any facility that repairs naval vessels and is located outside the United States or its territories .
3	77	20	VRs include only mission or safety essential items necessary for a ship to deploy or continue on its deployment .
4	97	14	Only work which falls within these boundaries will be authorized for VR accomplishment .
5	111	7	All other work will be deferred .
6	118	18	b. VR work screening activities provide the results of screening to customer ships in a screening message .
7	136	20	Approved work candidates are forwarded to the cognizant Regional Maintenance Center ( RMC ) for accomplishment or contract award .
8	156	15	After authorized jobs are received by the RMC , the following steps take place :
9	171	12	( 1 ) RMC Surveyor accomplishes shipcheck as ship schedule permits .
10	183	18	( 2 ) Cognizant RMC Surveyor writes work specifications or contract work specifications prior to ship arrival .
11	201	16	( 3 ) RMC or Contractor ship - checks take place upon ship ’s arrival .
12	217	24	For VR that Must be contracted , competitive bidding constraints require not less than three contractors be considered for contract award if possible .
13	241	20	( 4 ) When VR contracting is required , contract award occurs not later than arrival plus one day .
14	261	6	c. Voyage Repair Availability Execution .
15	267	35	( 1 ) The assigned Ashore Ships Maintenance Manager and Ship Superintendent or Surveyor will meet ship on arrival and will ensure the Job Order Specification or contract is in place , as applicable .
16	302	38	The assigned Ashore Ships Maintenance Manager and Ship Superintendent or Surveyor will ensure the Job Order Specification or technical portion of the contract is adhered to and provide liaison with the local industrial activity on technical matters .
17	340	25	It is the RMC Ship superintendent or Surveyor and Ship ’s Force responsibility to ensure the activity performing the VR complies with work specifications .
18	365	41	( 2 ) Where applicable , the Fleet Logistics Center ( FLC ) Naval Regional Contracting Detachment ( NRCD ) representative will award the contract and provide liaison with the contractor on contractual matters , including new work and payment .
19	406	17	( 3 ) A pre - production meeting will be scheduled , after the contractor shipcheck .
20	423	71	Purpose is for assigned Ashore Ships Maintenance Manager and Ship Superintendent or Surveyor to review with the Ship ’s Force , contents of the Job Order Specification or Contract Specification , ship - contractor coordination requirements ( if applicable ) , Quality Assurance ( QA ) requirements of Ship ’s Force and repair activity performing the VR , and list of government furnished material to be provided by the ship .
21	494	30	The ship should provide the RMC Ship Superintendent or Surveyor a list of the ship ’s Quality Assurance Inspectors ( QAI ) to be used during the VR period .
22	524	7	( 4 ) Daily Production Meeting .
23	531	41	The Ship ’s Maintenance Management Officer , Surveyor , and other essential personnel will meet daily to review progress , discuss daily production efforts , and remove possible “ interferences ” with the intent of minimizing length of the availability .
24	572	27	Early and frequent communication between all parties involved in the repair and maintenance process will help to ensure the overall success and effectiveness of any availability .
25	599	6	d. Growth and New Work .
26	605	42	( 1 ) Growth work identified during the open and inspect phase of the baseline repairs will be reviewed for cost and schedule impacts and incorporated in the work package by the RMC assigned Port Engineer or Surveyor , as applicable .
27	647	25	No growth work or new work is authorized to commence until FLC NRCD negotiates with the contractor and the appropriate contract documentation is issued .
28	672	16	( 2 ) New work must be processed and authorized without violating Public Law restrictions .
29	688	36	To assure these restrictions are not violated , the ship must submit an OPNAV 4790 / 2 K following the normal process and provide a copy to the assigned Ashore Ships Maintenance Manager or Surveyor .
30	724	17	Continuous Screening process will ensure that the forward maintenance activity receives it in a timely manner .
31	741	36	The Surveyor must determine the feasibility of completing new work and must obtain the required authorization from the cognizant organization ( FDRMC Naples , FDRMC Det Bahrain , COMLOG WESTPAC , SRF - JRMC ) .
32	777	29	e. Constructive changes are changes to contracts in the intent of work specifications directed at the contractor by anyone other than the surveyor or FLC - NRCD representative .
33	806	18	Since they are not pre - negotiated with the contractor , constructive changes are against the law .
34	824	25	Ship ’s Force personnel should be cautioned not to direct or otherwise influence contractor personnel to accomplish work not clearly delineated by contract specifications .
35	849	4	f. Contractor Limitations .
36	853	33	( 1 ) Military Specification material may be available from SRF - JRMC or requisitioned by the SRF - JRMC for contractor VR conducted on ships inport Yokosuka and Sasebo , Japan .
37	886	24	( 2 ) With the exception of lagging , Military Specification parts and material are not available to local contractors in other ports .
38	910	23	Some parts can be manufactured , But the material and parts required for work package execution should be provided by the ship .

45	1012	25	( 1 ) In the COMFIFTHFLT AOR , the Arab work week is Saturday through Wednesday with the weekend being on Thursday and Friday .
46	1037	20	( 2 ) Contractor ability to accomplish work is sometimes limited by Port Captain regulations , and local strikes .
