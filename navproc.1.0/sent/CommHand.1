3	73	13	Warships maintain their status even if civilians form part of the crew .
4	86	12	Ships need not be armed in order to qualify as warships .

6	120	25	U. S. Coast Guard vessels designated “ USCGC ” under the command of a commissioned officer are also “ warships ” under international law .
7	145	27	During international armed conflict at sea , warships are the only vessels that may exercise belligerent rights , which include the right to conduct offensive attacks .
8	172	27	Other vessels , such as auxiliary vessels and merchant vessels , are not entitled to conduct attacks in offensive combat operations in an international armed conflict .

14	274	28	A warship cannot be required to consent to an onboard search or inspection , nor may it be required to fly the flag of the host State .
15	302	48	Although warships are required to comply with coastal State traffic control , sewage , health , and quarantine restrictions instituted in conformance with the UNCLOS , a failure of compliance is subject only to diplomatic complaint or to coastal State orders to leave its territorial sea immediately .
16	350	42	Moreover , warships are immune from arrest and seizure , whether in national or international waters , and are exempt from foreign taxes and regulation and exercise exclusive control over all passengers and crew with regard to acts performed on board .

22	552	68	In response to questions concerning the presence of infectious diseases on visiting U. S. Navy ships , the U. S. diplomatic post may inform host governments that a commanding officer of a U. S.
