9	107	3	24.1 PURPOSE .
10	110	24	This chapter contains procedures for the inspection , repair and maintenance of wood decks and structures on wood - hulled ships and craft .
11	134	4	24.2 Wood decay .
12	138	4	24.2.1 Primary Causes .
13	142	18	Wood decay is caused by a fungus growth which breaks down the cell structure within the wood .
14	160	16	This fungus thrives in fresh water but its growth is significantly retarded by salt water .
15	176	19	Wood decay generally occurs in those spaces which are poorly ventilated and where fresh water has gained access .
16	195	18	Poor drainage , allowing fresh water to stand , even in small amounts , is particularly hazardous .
17	213	21	The primary causes of wood decay found in ships using wood for hulls , decking and structures are identified as :
18	234	30	a. Insufficient ventilation and air circulation especially in spaces plagued by dampness and high humidity ( i. e. , chill room platforms and areas around fresh water tanks ) .
19	264	12	b. Obstructed drainpipes , scuppers , limbers , and drain holes .
20	276	16	c. Uncaulked or poorly maintained deck seams , especially around plywood decking and Deckhouse areas .
21	292	7	d. Washing down with fresh water .
22	299	14	e. Depressions in the deck from sanding which allows fresh water to stand .
23	313	15	f. Leaking plumbing especially in heads , water closets , and food preparation areas .
24	328	3	24.2.2 Recognition .
25	331	15	Decay in the deck and hull structure is often concealed and hard to detect .
26	346	14	It is usually not recognizable by visible fungus except in joints between surfaces .
27	360	16	Decay may be suspected if paint coating is discolored or the wood surface is cupped .
28	376	11	The affected wood has a pronounced stringy , fibrous appearance .
29	387	26	Thoroughly decayed wood is brittle which , when dry , breaks easily across the grain with a distinct brash fracture and may crumble into powder .
30	413	23	Black stains spreading along the grain from ferrous metal fastenings are usually a result of chemical reactions instead of from decay fungi .
31	436	14	Testing procedures for suspected decay areas are detailed in reference ( a ) .
32	450	4	24.2.3 Preventive Measures .
33	454	11	Detailed preventive measures are described in reference ( a ) .
34	465	25	General preventive measures for the reduction of wood decay are identified in the following paragraphs , and should be accomplished by Ship ’s Force .
35	490	11	a. Correct or remove all interference with complete water runoff .
36	501	14	b. Repair fresh water leaks in plumbing drains and fresh water supply systems .
37	515	8	c. Maintain ventilation system in proper operation .
38	523	21	Ensure ventilation system filters are Kept clean , maintained clear of all foreign material , and ventilation terminals remain open .
39	544	21	d. Carefully caulk and maintain deck seams , especially around plywood decking , deckhouse , hull fittings and foundation areas .
40	565	16	e. In fair weather , open hatches and deck plates to supplement the air circulation .
41	581	15	f. Remove wet dunnage or shoring in below deck spaces and permit to dry .
42	596	8	g. Avoid washing down with fresh water .
43	604	10	Use only salt water due to its preservation Values .
44	614	28	h. Wash down the ship or craft with salt water following periods of inclement weather to eliminate fresh water and restore salt washed away by the rainfall .
45	642	7	i. Avoid heavy buildup of paint .
46	649	14	j. Check MCM bilges and accessible voids for standing fluids once each watch .
47	663	11	Identify and correct any leaks and promptly remove any fluids .
48	674	9	MCMs are designed to operate with dry bilges .
49	683	27	Prolonged contact with fluids will result in wood swell , which can lead to external glass reinforced plastic delamination , planking damage , and machinery misalignment .
50	710	4	24.2.4 Corrective Measures .
51	714	20	a. Treat new wood , used during new construction or in repaired areas , with a copper naphthenate preservative .
52	734	17	This product is produced in a clear and colorless form or in a bright green color .
53	751	24	The green preservative has a higher level of copper and is considered to be the more durable and efficient of the two preservatives .
54	775	37	If the treated wood is to be varnished , finished with light - colored paints or left bare , use the clear preservative since the green color will bleed through varnishes and light - colored paints .
55	812	33	b. Build up a heavy concentration of the preservative with a series of three or more heavy applications using a brush , spray or immersing the wood in a preservative filled tank .
56	845	21	On - going protection requires periodic application of the preservative to bare wood structures at about five - year intervals .
57	866	9	Wood treated on this basis will last indefinitely .
58	875	34	c. Early identification of decayed areas will allow damaged wood to be treated with an anti - decay product that will harden up the soft wood and prevent the further spread of decay .
59	909	25	The product , available commercially , is a two - part mixture with deep penetrating properties that fills wood pores with a capillary action .
60	934	64	d. Before a wood structure is so badly decayed that its replacement is necessary , a possible long lasting repair is made by drilling a series of 1 / 4 " to 3 / 8 " diameter holes in and around the affected areas and gravity feeding the anti - decay mixture in sufficient quantity to allow total penetration of the damaged area .
61	998	15	A guide for proper application of this product is provided with each repair kit .
62	1013	37	Avoid removing or disturbing bad wood during repairs , since the original wood , whether good or bad , serves as a container for the product and preserves the shape and size of the affected member .
63	1050	13	Initial curing of the product takes place about one hour after application .
64	1063	30	Total curing takes place after one week , at which time the treated wood resembles petrified wood and the growth of rot in the treated area is effectively stopped .
65	1093	13	Repairs should be accomplished by Ship ’s Force during regular maintenance periods .
66	1106	6	24.3 Deck and hull maintenance .
67	1112	4	24.3.1 Inspection Requirements .
68	1116	16	With reasonable care , wood - hulled ships can give many years of economical service .
69	1132	23	Make frequent inspections to detect any leaks beneath the covering board , around the deckhouse areas and seams in the deck planking .
70	1155	14	Reference ( a ) lists general maintenance requirements for wood - hulled ships .
71	1169	4	24.3.2 Maintenance Policies .
72	1173	13	Specific maintenance policies and repair practices are described in the following paragraphs .
73	1186	29	a. As a general policy , because of the ever present risk of decay developing beneath any wood coating , leave wood strip planked decks uncoated and unpainted .
74	1215	16	b. Limit the cleaning of wood decks to scrubbing with mild detergents and salt water .
75	1231	17	Never use fresh water for wash - downs since it encourages growth of decay producing fungi .
76	1248	14	Do not use strong detergents , acids , and bleaches for deck cleaning .
77	1262	5	Do not sand decks .
78	1267	18	c. Set up a routine of daily wetting down of wood strip planked decks with salt water .
79	1285	18	This wetting down causes strip deck planking to remain swollen and creates a tighter fit between planks .
80	1303	22	Wetting down is especially necessary during warm weather periods when the sun ’s heat will quickly dry out the deck planking .
81	1325	15	Do not allow water to accumulate in deck recesses for any length of time .
82	1340	21	d. Cover all plywood decks with a coating following the application and deck preparation procedures of reference ( b ) .
83	1361	30	e. Planking renewal will be approved by the TYCOM only on the basis of a technical survey that has positively shown specific need and complete justification for such renewal .
84	1391	17	Often used general terms such as " Rotten and Worn " are not considered sufficient justification .
85	1408	14	The technical basis for planking renewal must be formed in the following manner :
86	1422	24	( 1 ) Drill test bore holes in weather deck areas to find planking thickness in specific areas where plank wear is suspected .
87	1446	39	If the planking is not worn beyond the limits set forth in reference ( b ) , the planking will not be renewed unless other extenuating and justifiable circumstances dictate , and replacement is authorized by the TYCOM .
88	1485	14	( 2 ) Take boring plug samples of planking suspected of being decayed .
89	1499	7	Notify the TYCOM of inspection results .
90	1506	32	( 3 ) Once planking has reached the maximum wear limits ( found by bore test ) , the TYCOM will determine the need to replank or apply a deck coating .
91	1538	14	f. So far as practicable , repair deck leaks by recaulking deck seams .
92	1552	35	g. When deck planking wear limits have been reached , and other factors such as extensive deck leaks suggest use of a deck covering , a coating of polyurethane deck overlay may be used .
93	1587	25	Non - skid material must be Naval Sea Systems Command approved material compatible with the deck overlay as defined in reference ( b ) .
94	1612	19	h. Reset metallic planking fasteners when fastener heads are level with , or protrude above , deck level .
95	1631	26	Where the planking level is within 1 / 4 " or less of fastener head , filling with seam filler vice wooden plugging is authorized .
96	1657	24	Where bung plugs are installed , they must be set in black polyurethane seam filler per the requirements of reference ( c ) .
97	1681	22	i. Ships currently having polysulfide or polyurethane coated strip deck planking in good condition must continue to use the applied covering .
98	1703	18	Make minor repairs to this polyurethane coating as necessary using either a polysulfide or polyurethane repair kit .
99	1721	18	When the polysulfide covering is no longer economically repairable , replace it with a polyurethane type coating .
100	1739	16	Repairing cracks and holes in impervious deck coatings must be accomplished as soon as practical .
101	1755	13	Failure to do so will lead to deck rot and costly repairs .
102	1768	5	24.3.3 Deck Covering Repairs .
103	1773	22	Interior and exterior deck covering material is prescribed by Military Specifications and will be installed only as approved by the TYCOM .
104	1795	8	Repair previously installed deck coverings as necessary .
105	1803	14	Reference ( b ) prescribes approved materials and preparation procedures for wooden decks .
106	1817	4	24.3.4 Caulking Techniques .
107	1821	18	Removal of old caulking from leaking seams and recaulking is the standard method for repairing deck leaks .
108	1839	20	Fill the caulked seams with a black polyurethane seam filler , per the requirements of reference ( c ) .
109	1859	10	Before filling , caulk the seams with sufficient cotton .
110	1869	14	Seam out gaging ( beveling ) as specified in reference ( d ) .
111	1883	28	Detailed instructions concerning equipment used , the preparation of seams , the method of application and primers to be used are described in reference ( b ) .
112	1911	8	24.3.5 Weather Deck or Planked Deck Repair .
113	1919	16	a. Remove all loose or decayed cotton or oakum caulking after removing all seam filler .
114	1935	34	In areas where caulking is found to be in good condition , set this material deeper into the seam opening , ensuring it is driven in solidly to make room for additional caulking .
115	1969	14	b. Small , tight seams will require a new single thread of cotton .
116	1983	18	The size of the seam in width and depth determines the amount of cotton or oakum required .
117	2001	32	Install sufficient cotton or oakum so that the level of the top of the caulking is 1 / 4 " to 3 / 8 " below the surface of the decking .
118	2033	9	This will allow room for the seam filler .
119	2042	36	c. Unless marine glue ( pitch ) is used as a seam filler , seal the surface of the caulked cotton or oakum with a special seam primer that is compatible with the seam filler .
120	2078	12	Do not use a rubber - type seam filler over oakum .
121	2090	35	d. Prime or fill newly caulked seams at the end of each day ’s caulking to keep moisture out of the caulking material and to protect the dry surface of the deck plank seams .
122	2125	27	e. Rubber type seam fillers that are installed in seams with a caulking gun must also be hand worked into the seam with a putty knife .
123	2152	13	This is necessary to eliminate air pockets and voids in the seam .
124	2165	17	Hand working of the seam filler must be in one single direction to avoid air pockets .
125	2182	5	24.3.6 Underwater Planking Repairs .
126	2187	12	a. The forward and after rabbet must receive a thorough inspection .
127	2199	30	The rabbet seam in the stern area is covered with an anchor chafe plate and is not available for inspection or repair unless the anchor chafe plate is removed .
128	2229	26	Slack or rotten caulking allows for infestation of marine burrowers and decay which , in the case of the rabbet seams forward , goes undetected .
129	2255	24	b. Inspect and test caulked plank seams covered with bottom sheathing for soundness whenever areas are exposed due to the removal of sheathing .
130	2279	21	In most cases , the seams have been covered for many years and have not been available for periodic maintenance .
131	2300	16	These seams , although covered with sheathing , do eventually waste away or become slack .
132	2316	20	The seams at the planking butts are more susceptible to slackening and erosion due to movement at the joints .
133	2336	17	Under normal conditions , it is necessary to recaulk these joints every 10 to 15 years .
134	2353	40	c. If the outer strand of oakum caulking appears to be satisfactory , then the seam may be repaired by setting the existing caulking deep into the seam and adding more strands of oakum to fill the seam depth .
135	2393	28	If the old caulking is wasted away or decayed , clean out the seam and remove all caulking and residue to make room for the new material .
136	2421	23	d. Before filling the newly caulked seam with a seam compound , paint the oakum and seam with anti - fouling paint .
137	2444	21	Painting the seam protects the oakum from marine burrowers and primes the wood in the way of the seam filler .
138	2465	22	Painting the oakum produces a hard surface finish which also makes a water barrier necessary for the protection of the oakum .
139	2487	6	24.4 Surface preparation and painting .
140	2493	4	24.4.1 General Techniques .
141	2497	27	The greatest single factor affecting the performance of any paint system is the method and care used in the preparation of the surface to be coated .
142	2524	17	The preservation of wooden ships presents some unique problems not encountered in other types of ships .
143	2541	24	Reference ( e ) provides guidance for surface preparation materials and methods of application , techniques , and general safety precautions for painting .
144	2565	6	24.4.2 Preparation and Painting Policies .
145	2571	17	Specific TYCOM policies pertaining to the preparation and paint application are identified in the following paragraphs :
146	2588	35	a. The use of torches to blister the existing paint coating for removal is authorized ; however , care must be taken to guard against damage to other items or equipment in the vicinity .
147	2623	22	Avoid application of heat on or near items such as electric wiring , plastics , gaskets , and all flammable materials .
148	2645	11	Use only enough heat as required to blister the paint .
149	2656	18	Excessive heat chars the wood fibers and removal of the charred wood results in an uneven surface .
150	2674	12	Remove all interferences that can reasonably be removed before applying heat .
151	2686	12	This includes all label plates , brackets , clips , etc .
152	2698	16	b. Scraping tools used to remove blistered paint must be kept sharp to be effective .
153	2714	24	Do all scraping in the direction of the wood grain to prevent shredding of wood fibers and gouging of the bare wood surface .
154	2738	14	This phase of paint removal is important in preparing the surface for sanding .
155	2752	15	c. All areas stripped as previously described are now ready for sanding before priming .
156	2767	21	Hand sanding , with wooden blocks where practicable , using the correct grit paper , is the prescribed final step .
157	2788	22	Careful dusting before paint application is absolutely necessary to achieve a good primer bond , or bond between subsequent paint coats .
158	2810	15	( 1 ) Power disc sanders are not authorized for use in surface preparation .
159	2825	16	Improper use of the disc sander is the biggest cause of uneven surfaces and damage .
160	2841	24	( 2 ) Belt sanders and vibrating sanders are authorized for use in preparing the hull freeboard for priming and top - coating .
161	2865	6	24.5 WOODEN HULL BOTTOM SHEATHING .
162	2871	45	For bottom sheathing to be effective and to provide protection to the underlying hull planking , the sheathing must fit the shape of the vessel ’s contoured bottom , be securely fastened , and be faired to the level of adjoining pieces of sheathing .
163	2916	14	The sheathing must be installed per the requirements of reference ( a ) .
164	2930	29	a. Sheathing the bottoms of wood vessels serves to protect the hull from burrowers , especially if the vessels are to endure long periods between dry - dockings .
165	2959	21	b. For vessels that are active and are dry - docked annually , the use of sheathing is not Required .
166	2980	6	24.6 WOODEN SEA CHEST FOUNDATIONS .
167	2986	27	a. To prevent overheating of the wood filler blocks and wood cap blocks in sea chests , the wood must be insulated from the metal fittings .
168	3013	25	Use of delron sleeves or bushings around the body of the through - hull fitting and around the bolt fastenings is one Approved method .
169	3038	48	b. A Cathodic Corrosion Control system using an impressed current through anodes installed on boat bottoms isolates the anode fittings with the use of delron bushings and by the application of a mastic material applied over bare wood in a 36 ” diameter Area around the anode .
170	3086	11	c. Replace wood fillers and caps that are badly decayed .
171	3097	33	If repairs cannot be made immediately , then treat the bad wood with a preservative or decay inhibitor to slow up the rate of deterioration until the bad wood can be replaced .
172	3130	33	When new fillers in the Form of blocks and caps are fabricated , they should be treated with preservative prior to installation and after the wood has been finally shaped and fitted .
