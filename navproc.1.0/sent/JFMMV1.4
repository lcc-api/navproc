0	0	13	3.3.3 Pre - Reactor Safeguard Examination ( Nuclear Powered Ships only ) .
1	13	3	a. Purpose .
2	16	29	To evaluate the readiness of the Engineering or Reactor Department to undergo an RSE by representatives of Naval Sea Systems Command Nuclear Propulsion Directorate ( NAVSEA 08 ) .
3	45	22	Appendix C of this chapter provides a sample Pre - RSE Notice which should be tailored to fit your specific platform .
4	67	3	b. Conduct .
5	70	25	The Pre - RSE performed by the ISIC with TYCOM assistance is not intended to duplicate the inspections for which readiness is being evaluated .
6	95	19	It is prudent , however , to use an inspection plan similar to that employed by NAVSEA 08 .
7	114	16	Normally the crew â€™s readiness can be assessed within two days using such a plan .
8	130	15	The Supervising Authority will arrange for minimum industrial activity work interference during this inspection .
9	145	3	c. Scheduling .
10	148	15	The ISIC must conduct a Pre - RSE within six weeks of intended criticality .
11	163	44	The Pre - RSE will be scheduled such that the qualification program and material condition of the ship are sufficiently complete to allow for a thorough inspection , but early enough to allow time for the correction of identified deficiencies prior to criticality .
12	207	27	The TYCOM should be advised approximately two months prior to the tentative date and confirmed dates should be established approximately one month prior to the inspection .
13	234	7	d. Composition of the Inspection Team .
14	241	10	The Pre - RSE Inspection Team should consist of :
15	251	21	( 1 ) A nuclear trained member of the ISIC Staff , usually the Deputy Commander for Readiness or Training .
16	272	13	( 2 ) A qualified nuclear engineer with experience in the billet .
17	285	12	( 3 ) A nuclear trained officer from the TYCOM Staff .
18	297	25	Arrangements for the participation of TYCOM Staff members should be initiated by the ISIC at least one month prior to the anticipated inspection date .
19	322	21	( 4 ) The Prospective Commanding Officer ( PCO ) of the next local ship in a new construction status .
20	343	9	( 5 ) The TYCOM industrial activity representative .
21	352	3	e. Reports .
22	355	23	The Senior Inspector should provide the ship with an informal report of the findings with a copy to the ISIC and TYCOM .
23	378	4	f. Inspection Areas .
24	382	14	The Pre - RSE should , as a minimum , encompass the following :
25	396	7	( 1 ) An administrative review .
26	403	17	( 2 ) Observation of basic drills and evolutions not requiring reactor operation or special conditions .
27	420	9	( 3 ) Personnel interviews and written tests .
28	429	6	( 4 ) Material inspection .
