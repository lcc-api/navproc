3	68	12	a. The following types of problems should be reported as PDDIs :
4	80	20	( 1 ) Recurring failures in a piece of equipment or machinery such that the reliability is considered unsatisfactory .
5	100	21	( 2 ) Major equipment or component malfunction which requires outside assistance to correct ( vendor or industrial activity ) .
6	121	19	( 3 ) Symptoms of major machinery problems which require investigation to determine the extent of the problem .
7	140	16	( Improper temperatures , pressures , leakage , vibration , noise , etc . ) .
8	156	16	( 4 ) Insufficient supply support for specific equipment or machinery based on operational experience .

13	238	34	Insert an amplification data set immediately after the Parts Identification data set consisting of “ AMPN / PDDI : ___ - ___// ” , ensuring that the CASREP includes all appropriate PDDI addressees .
14	272	8	A separate PDDI must also be submitted .
15	280	17	( 8 ) Identification of any condition or defect which requires a Departure from Specification request .
16	297	22	( 9 ) Improper alignment , clearance , or resistance to ground which indicates an unaccounted for change from baseline data .

22	400	15	Refer to the AT or INSURV Number in the text of the deficiency description .
23	415	2	NOTE :
24	417	20	DEFICIENCIES AND MATERIAL PROBLEMS WHICH ARE CORRECTED BY SHIP ’S FORCE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SHOULD NOT BE REPORTED AS PDDIs .
25	437	3	b. Reporting .
26	440	48	( 1 ) Between delivery and GMI or FCT , uncorrected deficiencies of the nature described in paragraph 5.6 of this chapter should be documented in the Current Ship ’s Maintenance Project ( CSMP ) and presented to the INSURV Board for consideration during GMI or FCT .
27	488	38	( 2 ) Problems requiring corrective action prior to PSA , or of such significance that planning will have to commence as early as possible , should be reported by OPNAV 4790 / 2 K without delay .
28	526	25	The OPNAV 4790 / 2 K must contain the sequential identification number of the PDDI and a brief description of the problem being reported .
29	551	7	Multiple PDDIs per report are encouraged .
30	558	18	Items reported by OPNAV 4790 / 2 K should be included in the next regular PDDI report .
31	576	58	The OPNAV 4790 / 2 K should also be sent by message , or e - mail where appropriate , and must be addressed to the Supervising Authority , with information copies to the Navy Shipbuilding Program Manager , TYCOM ( N40 ) , the ISIC , and NAVSEA 08 ( for items with nuclear cognizance ) .
32	634	25	( 3 ) Routine PDDIs must be reported by OPNAV 4790 / 2 K and summarized at least monthly after the GMI or FCT .
33	659	33	( 4 ) All PDDIs must be assigned a sequential number identifying the item for administrative purposes and a priority in the “ ship ” column of the 4760 - 1 Report .
34	692	9	This forms Part E of the Consolidated Report .
35	701	19	Report Form 4760 - 1 will be provided to the ship at the GMI or FCT Card Conference .

37	734	10	( a ) Advance copy to the Supervising Authority .
38	744	12	( b ) Advance copy to the Navy Shipbuilding Program Manager .
39	756	8	( Nuclear deficiencies to NAVSEA 08 ) .
40	764	8	( c ) Copy to the ISIC .
41	772	18	( d ) Original to the Supervising Authority via the TYCOM and the Navy Shipbuilding Program Manager .
42	790	30	( 6 ) All PDDIs must be assigned a Job Sequence Number ( JSN ) in the ship 's JSN log prior to input into the ship ’s CSMP .
43	820	24	The CSMP summary line ( Block 37 , OPNAV 4790 / 2 K ) will contain the PDDI sequential number for cross reference .
