0	0	5	22.3.1 Hydrostatic Pressure Testing .
1	5	37	a. Hydrostatic pressure testing of submarine antennas with cables attached prior to initial installation ( or after any maintenance actions that requires the disassembly of the antenna ) is mandatory except for buoys and floating wires .
2	42	34	This pre - installation test is intended solely to verify the correctness of the final assembly and does not equal or replace the more elaborate acceptance testing required for various individual manufactured components .
3	76	13	Submarine communications antennas that are required to be hydrostatic pressure tested are :
4	89	2	Note :
5	91	26	All oe - 538 / 592 mast are Hydrostatically tested at either the oe - 538 / 592 depot or waterfront I - level facility .
6	117	22	( 1 ) Multifunction Masts , OE - 538 ( SSNs ) and OE - 592 ( SSBNs and SSGNs ) .
7	139	2	NOTE :
8	141	25	ALL SUBHDR MASTS ARE HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED AT THE Subhdr national maintenance center ( NMC ) prior to being issued to the fleet for installation .
9	166	16	( 2 ) Submarine High Data Rate Mast , OE - 562 ( SubHDR ) .
10	182	7	b. Buoys that are excluded are :
11	189	28	( 1 ) Submarine Launched One - Way Tactical ( SLOT ) Buoys ( AN / BRT - 1 and An / BRT - 1 a ) .
12	217	28	( 2 ) Submarine Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon ( SEPIRB ) Buoy ( T - 1630 / SRT or T - 1630 A / SRT ) .
13	245	16	c. All versions of Floating wires are excluded ( i. e. Buoyant Cable Antennas ) .
14	261	2	Note :
15	263	42	The towed buoy antenna , an / Brr - 6 ( Ssbn 730 - 738 ) and the an / Brr - 6 B ( Ssbn 739 - 743 ) will be hydrostatic tested before installation according to the maintenance manual .
