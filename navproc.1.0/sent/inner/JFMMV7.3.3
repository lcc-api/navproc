0	0	7	5.7.3 Quantification of the Labor Estimate .
1	7	17	a. Most work activities are estimated on the basis of the estimator ’s judgment and experience .
2	24	26	Even in the absence of experience , the estimator can still assign reasonable estimates based on good judgment and knowledge of the work being estimated .
3	50	34	By mentally going through each step of the work required , the estimator can assign a labor estimate based on judgment of the time required to accomplish each step of the work process .
4	84	19	Such detailed estimating can parallel the industrial engineering methods used to develop estimating standards for repetitive type work .
5	103	17	Industrial engineering standards are the result of comprehensive time and motion studies of a work process .
6	120	11	The time required to perform each operation is measured repetitively .
7	131	37	Through analysis , a standard is developed for each step , allowances are made for distractions and rest periods and a standard allowance is made by summing the standard for each step plus other applicable allowances .
8	168	19	In mentally paralleling this process , the estimator is providing the time for each step or motion required .
9	187	22	The estimates for each step are summed and additional allowances are added for distractions , rest periods and other possible considerations .
10	209	10	The other considerations include such items as the following :
11	219	7	( 1 ) Location of Work :
12	226	18	Estimates for a work operation should be greater when the operation is performed in a congested area .
13	244	46	For example , repairs to a water fountain in a congested machinery space with other work in progress would be more time - consuming than the same repairs to a similar water fountain located on the mess decks , in the absence of other work .
14	290	31	Work operations of any kind are more time - consuming when performed in conjunction with other work ( mutual interference ) or when performed in a cramped or congested area .
15	321	37	Likewise , estimates should be escalated for work performed in a hostile environment such as in tanks or voids , in poorly ventilated spaces , in hot or cold spaces , in contaminated atmospheres , etc .
16	358	8	( 2 ) Ship ’s Force Work :
17	366	36	When work is being performed on the same equipment or system by both the contractor work force and the Ship ’s Force , there is normally an added degree of mutual interference to be considered .
18	402	30	Even when the two work forces are not in the same space , the mutual interference may lead to inefficiencies that should be considered in estimating the contractor work .
19	432	6	( 3 ) Prevailing Weather :
20	438	19	When the geographic area for an assigned availability is known , the geographic weather pattern should be considered .
21	457	17	Likewise , if the time of year is known , the seasonal weather should be considered .
22	474	28	For example , it is normally more costly to blast and paint the underwater body of a ship hull in below freezing weather than in milder weather .
23	502	16	Similarly , the weather may also impact paint curing times and other time factors considered .
24	518	8	( 4 ) Ship ’s Material Condition :
25	526	27	Estimating Standards , historical estimates , “ Rules of Thumb ” and other estimating tools available for use are generally applicable under “ average ” conditions .
26	553	17	Estimates for many work operations should be factored to reflect the material condition of the ship .
27	570	15	If the ship is in average condition , the standards need not be factored .
28	585	21	If the ship is new , then the standards should be reduced to reflect the better than average material condition .
29	606	16	If the ship is in very poor material condition , the estimate should be increased .
30	622	35	Not all work operations are affected by the ship ’s general material Condition ; However , many are , such as surface preparations , painting , insulation and lagging , structural repairs , etc .
31	657	8	( 5 ) Category I Standard Items :
32	665	25	The NAVSEA Category I SIs are invoked in work packages following the guidance provided by the Standard Specification for Ship Repair and Alteration Committee .
33	690	25	When invoked in a job order , the provisions of the Category I SI apply for the duration of the availability without further reference .
34	715	33	The estimator must know which Category I SI is applicable for the work and what the direct , hard - core labor cost impact of each SI is on the work required .
35	748	33	Each time the provisions of the Category I SI are applicable in a work item , an allowance should be made to accomplish the hard - core labor requirements of the SI .
36	781	22	An SI will be invoked if any work in the areas addressed in the SI is likely in the work package .
37	803	16	Not all Category I SIs will have a direct hard - core labor cost impact .
38	819	11	Those that do are discussed briefly in the following sections .
39	830	13	( a ) SI 009 - 04 : Quality System ; provide .

85	1782	19	This requires the contractor to comply with Volume IV , Chapter 10 of this manual regarding work authorization .
86	1801	36	Specifically , the contractor is required to submit a Work Authorization Form to the designated representative of the ship ’s Commanding Officer for authorization to start work on each Work Item in the Job Order .
87	1837	19	This is considered an overhead or indirect charge so no direct labor charges are included in any estimates .
88	1856	20	b. References ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) also can have significant labor impact .
89	1876	25	Appendix C is provided as a check - off list to assist the estimator in properly considering the impact of Category I Standard Items .
90	1901	25	Each of these SIs must be fully understood before an estimator can properly allow for the cost impact in performance of the work required .
91	1926	21	Those items characterized as “ labor intensive ” must have detailed estimates prepared to reflect the scope of work required .
92	1947	12	The scope of work will vary significantly from job to job .
93	1959	4	5.7.4 Material Estimating .
94	1963	15	a. The material estimate usually receives the least attention of all the estimates provided .
95	1978	26	This may not significantly affect a small job , but the accumulation of small errors on a large package can affect the total estimate considerably .
96	2004	11	When estimating material costs , the following must be considered :
97	2015	16	( 1 ) The kinds and quantity of each material required to accomplish the work .
98	2031	13	( 2 ) Whether the materials are procurable or will be manufactured .
99	2044	13	( 3 ) The “ lead time ” for procuring the material .
100	2057	9	( 4 ) Is the material commercially available ?
101	2066	12	( 5 ) The current or future price for the material .
102	2078	50	b. The estimator is not expected to be as familiar with the material pricing as a purchasing agent , but should be familiar with the market , should know what is scarce and what is not available from commercial sources and should keep up with current prices and availability .
103	2128	21	The estimator should also use drawing material lists , equipment technical manuals and Allowance Parts Lists to determine material requirements .
104	2149	25	Cost estimates are then based upon records of previous recent purchases , current Government and vendor catalogs and consultation with Government and commercial sources .
