0	0	4	24.2 Wood decay .
1	4	4	24.2.1 Primary Causes .
2	8	18	Wood decay is caused by a fungus growth which breaks down the cell structure within the wood .
3	26	16	This fungus thrives in fresh water but its growth is significantly retarded by salt water .
4	42	19	Wood decay generally occurs in those spaces which are poorly ventilated and where fresh water has gained access .
5	61	18	Poor drainage , allowing fresh water to stand , even in small amounts , is particularly hazardous .
6	79	21	The primary causes of wood decay found in ships using wood for hulls , decking and structures are identified as :
7	100	30	a. Insufficient ventilation and air circulation especially in spaces plagued by dampness and high humidity ( i. e. , chill room platforms and areas around fresh water tanks ) .
8	130	12	b. Obstructed drainpipes , scuppers , limbers , and drain holes .
9	142	16	c. Uncaulked or poorly maintained deck seams , especially around plywood decking and Deckhouse areas .
10	158	7	d. Washing down with fresh water .
11	165	14	e. Depressions in the deck from sanding which allows fresh water to stand .
12	179	15	f. Leaking plumbing especially in heads , water closets , and food preparation areas .
13	194	3	24.2.2 Recognition .
14	197	15	Decay in the deck and hull structure is often concealed and hard to detect .
15	212	14	It is usually not recognizable by visible fungus except in joints between surfaces .
16	226	16	Decay may be suspected if paint coating is discolored or the wood surface is cupped .
17	242	11	The affected wood has a pronounced stringy , fibrous appearance .
18	253	26	Thoroughly decayed wood is brittle which , when dry , breaks easily across the grain with a distinct brash fracture and may crumble into powder .
19	279	23	Black stains spreading along the grain from ferrous metal fastenings are usually a result of chemical reactions instead of from decay fungi .
20	302	14	Testing procedures for suspected decay areas are detailed in reference ( a ) .
21	316	4	24.2.3 Preventive Measures .
22	320	11	Detailed preventive measures are described in reference ( a ) .
23	331	25	General preventive measures for the reduction of wood decay are identified in the following paragraphs , and should be accomplished by Ship ’s Force .
24	356	11	a. Correct or remove all interference with complete water runoff .
25	367	14	b. Repair fresh water leaks in plumbing drains and fresh water supply systems .
26	381	8	c. Maintain ventilation system in proper operation .
27	389	21	Ensure ventilation system filters are Kept clean , maintained clear of all foreign material , and ventilation terminals remain open .
28	410	21	d. Carefully caulk and maintain deck seams , especially around plywood decking , deckhouse , hull fittings and foundation areas .
29	431	16	e. In fair weather , open hatches and deck plates to supplement the air circulation .
30	447	15	f. Remove wet dunnage or shoring in below deck spaces and permit to dry .
31	462	8	g. Avoid washing down with fresh water .
32	470	10	Use only salt water due to its preservation Values .
33	480	28	h. Wash down the ship or craft with salt water following periods of inclement weather to eliminate fresh water and restore salt washed away by the rainfall .
34	508	7	i. Avoid heavy buildup of paint .
35	515	14	j. Check MCM bilges and accessible voids for standing fluids once each watch .
36	529	11	Identify and correct any leaks and promptly remove any fluids .
37	540	9	MCMs are designed to operate with dry bilges .
38	549	27	Prolonged contact with fluids will result in wood swell , which can lead to external glass reinforced plastic delamination , planking damage , and machinery misalignment .
39	576	4	24.2.4 Corrective Measures .
40	580	20	a. Treat new wood , used during new construction or in repaired areas , with a copper naphthenate preservative .
41	600	17	This product is produced in a clear and colorless form or in a bright green color .
42	617	24	The green preservative has a higher level of copper and is considered to be the more durable and efficient of the two preservatives .
43	641	37	If the treated wood is to be varnished , finished with light - colored paints or left bare , use the clear preservative since the green color will bleed through varnishes and light - colored paints .
44	678	33	b. Build up a heavy concentration of the preservative with a series of three or more heavy applications using a brush , spray or immersing the wood in a preservative filled tank .
45	711	21	On - going protection requires periodic application of the preservative to bare wood structures at about five - year intervals .
46	732	9	Wood treated on this basis will last indefinitely .
47	741	34	c. Early identification of decayed areas will allow damaged wood to be treated with an anti - decay product that will harden up the soft wood and prevent the further spread of decay .
48	775	25	The product , available commercially , is a two - part mixture with deep penetrating properties that fills wood pores with a capillary action .
49	800	64	d. Before a wood structure is so badly decayed that its replacement is necessary , a possible long lasting repair is made by drilling a series of 1 / 4 " to 3 / 8 " diameter holes in and around the affected areas and gravity feeding the anti - decay mixture in sufficient quantity to allow total penetration of the damaged area .
50	864	15	A guide for proper application of this product is provided with each repair kit .
51	879	37	Avoid removing or disturbing bad wood during repairs , since the original wood , whether good or bad , serves as a container for the product and preserves the shape and size of the affected member .
52	916	13	Initial curing of the product takes place about one hour after application .
53	929	30	Total curing takes place after one week , at which time the treated wood resembles petrified wood and the growth of rot in the treated area is effectively stopped .
54	959	13	Repairs should be accomplished by Ship ’s Force during regular maintenance periods .
