1	3	5	22.3.1 Hydrostatic Pressure Testing .
2	8	37	a. Hydrostatic pressure testing of submarine antennas with cables attached prior to initial installation ( or after any maintenance actions that requires the disassembly of the antenna ) is mandatory except for buoys and floating wires .
3	45	34	This pre - installation test is intended solely to verify the correctness of the final assembly and does not equal or replace the more elaborate acceptance testing required for various individual manufactured components .
4	79	13	Submarine communications antennas that are required to be hydrostatic pressure tested are :
5	92	2	Note :
6	94	26	All oe - 538 / 592 mast are Hydrostatically tested at either the oe - 538 / 592 depot or waterfront I - level facility .
7	120	22	( 1 ) Multifunction Masts , OE - 538 ( SSNs ) and OE - 592 ( SSBNs and SSGNs ) .
8	142	2	NOTE :
9	144	25	ALL SUBHDR MASTS ARE HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED AT THE Subhdr national maintenance center ( NMC ) prior to being issued to the fleet for installation .
10	169	16	( 2 ) Submarine High Data Rate Mast , OE - 562 ( SubHDR ) .
11	185	7	b. Buoys that are excluded are :
12	192	28	( 1 ) Submarine Launched One - Way Tactical ( SLOT ) Buoys ( AN / BRT - 1 and An / BRT - 1 a ) .
13	220	28	( 2 ) Submarine Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon ( SEPIRB ) Buoy ( T - 1630 / SRT or T - 1630 A / SRT ) .
14	248	16	c. All versions of Floating wires are excluded ( i. e. Buoyant Cable Antennas ) .
15	264	2	Note :
16	266	42	The towed buoy antenna , an / Brr - 6 ( Ssbn 730 - 738 ) and the an / Brr - 6 B ( Ssbn 739 - 743 ) will be hydrostatic tested before installation according to the maintenance manual .
17	308	4	22.3.2 Fleet Maintenance .
18	312	29	Maintenance actions conducted by Fleet Maintenance Activities or Ship ’s Force regarding the watertight integrity test requirements between submarine antennas and their respective hull connectors , must be :
19	341	40	a. When the antenna or cable is disconnected or replaced shipboard , the Technical Work Document will include the following checks in the assembly procedure to reconnect the cable to the base of the antenna or electrical hull fitting :
20	381	19	( 1 ) Craftsman verification that surface finishes of O - ring seating surfaces are per applicable specifications .
21	400	18	( 2 ) Craftsman verification that the O - ring is properly installed and per applicable specifications .
22	418	35	( 3 ) For submarine SubHDR and Photonics systems outboard cable removal and replacement , accomplish per Volume V , Part I , Chapter 7 , Appendix B , NOTE 31 of this manual .
23	453	62	b. Prior to performing a deep dive certification after a maintenance action , passive testing or pre - energize testing , or both , must be performed following the system specific Technical Manual , SUBMEPP approved Maintenance Standard , SUBMEPP approved Standard Test Procedure or Maintenance Requirement Card ( MRC ) to ensure the system is not grounded prior to use .
24	515	57	c. Upon completion of a deep dive certification for a maintenance action , passive testing , pre - energize testing , or both , must be performed following the system specific Technical Manual , SUBMEPP approved Maintenance Standard , SUBMEPP approved Standard Test Procedure or MRC to ensure the system is not grounded prior to use .
25	572	3	22.4 Procedure .
26	575	31	a. Upon completion of maintenance and before underway for submerged operations , the ship must place CAUTION tags on the Main Power Switch or transmit keys for the affected antennas .
27	606	48	The Amplifying Instructions for the CAUTION tags will state - “ DO NOT OPERATE OR TRANSMIT ON THIS ANTENNA UNTIL COMPLETION OF PASSIVE CHECKS FOLLOWING A DIVE TO TEST DEPTH . PASSIVE CHECKS MUST BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH USE UNTIL THE DEEP DIVE IS COMPLETE . ”
28	654	27	b. It is understood that in some cases , due to water depth restrictions , the deep dive may not be performed for quite some time .
29	681	18	In these cases , the ship should dive to the maximum depth possible and conduct passive checks .
30	699	53	Provided the checks are satisfactory , the CAUTION tag may be replaced with one stating - “ DO NOT OPERATE OR TRANSMIT ON THIS ANTENNA FOLLOWING OPERATIONS GREATER THAN ( enter max depth obtained ) . PASSIVE CHECKS MUST BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH USE UNTIL THE DEEP DIVE IS COMPLETED . ”
31	752	45	c. The tag ( s ) may be removed following completion of a deep dive to test depth and completion of satisfactory passive testing performed following the system specific technical manuals or Maintenance Index Pages and MRCs to ensure the system is not grounded .
