0	0	7	5.7.4.1 Contractor vs. Government Furnished Material .
1	7	14	In estimating material costs , no distinction is made between CFM and GFM .
2	21	23	All material will be priced the same way using either Government or commercial prices , whichever is most readily available and appropriate .
3	44	37	Generally speaking , because the Government purchases supplies in large lot quantities , the cost to the Government will be less than it would be to a private contractor making single item or small lot purchases .
4	81	51	For this reason , Government prices should not be used when estimating costs for CFM in a work item , however , because the allowable variance in Class F estimates is 40 percent , it is permissible to use either commercial or Government material prices for Class F material estimates .
5	132	31	This estimate should not include the cost of material to be provided as Special Program Material or Centrally Procured Material in support of the Navy Modernization Process ( NMP ) .
6	163	22	Likewise , the cost of repairable items under special turn - around programs should not be included in the work package .
7	185	23	In developing estimates for work items , a decision about CFM vs. GFM must be made before the estimate can be finalized .
8	208	11	CFM estimates are provided on the reverse side of Appendix A.
9	219	16	It is general Department of Defense policy that contractors provide all material necessary for performance .
10	235	26	That means simply that all material should be CFM except where it is in the best interest of the Government to provide material as GFM .
11	261	7	Exceptions to the CFM policy include :
12	268	42	a. Items in long supply in the Navy Supply System ( i. e. , items stocked far in excess of expected item demand ) should be provided as GFM since it would be wasteful to require contractors to buy such materials .
13	310	33	b. Items with a set shelf life that will expire before normal draw down in the supply system should be issued as GFM if such usage remains within the shelf life requirements .
14	343	11	c. Long Lead Time Material should be provided as GFM .
15	354	36	In Government procurements , items that are not commercially available within the time period after contract award and the time the contractor needs the material for production should be considered as Long Lead Time Material .
16	390	9	d. Standardization material should be provided as GFM .
17	399	19	This material is the Special Program Material and the Centrally Procured Material purchased in support of the NMP .
18	418	12	e. Material requiring Provisioning Technical Data should be provided as GFM .
19	430	20	Normally , repair material does not require Provisioning Technical Data because it is already stocked in the supply system .
20	450	19	f. Material items to be changed out under special turnaround or repairable programs should be provided as GFM .
21	469	11	g. Material for contractor work performed outside of the U. S.
22	480	19	Overseas contractors may not have ready access to materials meeting Navy specifications and are often procured as GFM .
