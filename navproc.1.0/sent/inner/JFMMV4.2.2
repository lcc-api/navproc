1	3	21	Historically during space , tank or void closeout , a large number of diverse and inconspicuous items have been overlooked .
2	24	18	These items have , at times , seriously degraded both material readiness and acoustic signature of submarines .
3	42	31	This section establishes a procedure to ensure a thorough certification of all spaces prior to final closeout and provides a check - off list when re - entry is required .
4	73	13	The check - off list or sheet is not all - inclusive .
5	86	20	Common sense and effective use of personnel experience and knowledge must be used to ensure complete and thorough inspections .
6	106	42	A review of references ( g ) , ( h ) and ( i ) should be performed to determine if a formal report of unscheduled visual inspection is required to be submitted for tank and voids being entered or closed .
7	148	15	Non - steel damping and acoustic restraining covers are not required to be painted .
8	163	5	Accidental overspray is acceptable .
9	168	16	Full paint out of damping restraining covers and acoustic tile covers is not the intent .
10	184	37	If damping and acoustic tiles are painted , they must be checked to ensure that the paint will not bridge the gap between the rubber and the restraining cover more than 75 % over an area .
11	221	9	Degradation of the performance of tiles is possible .
12	230	30	A suggested way to repair the area is to score the gap between the restraining cover and the damping tile and between the acoustic tile covers and the rubber .
13	260	9	Previously painted serviceable tiles may remain in service .
14	269	9	Reference ( g ) allows paint on piping .
15	278	1	NOTE
16	279	17	APPENDIX G MAY BE USED AS AN AID FOR ENTERING SUBMARINE SPACES , TANKS AND VOIDS .
