1	6	4	24.3.1 Inspection Requirements .
2	10	16	With reasonable care , wood - hulled ships can give many years of economical service .
3	26	23	Make frequent inspections to detect any leaks beneath the covering board , around the deckhouse areas and seams in the deck planking .
4	49	14	Reference ( a ) lists general maintenance requirements for wood - hulled ships .
5	63	4	24.3.2 Maintenance Policies .
6	67	13	Specific maintenance policies and repair practices are described in the following paragraphs .
7	80	29	a. As a general policy , because of the ever present risk of decay developing beneath any wood coating , leave wood strip planked decks uncoated and unpainted .
8	109	16	b. Limit the cleaning of wood decks to scrubbing with mild detergents and salt water .
9	125	17	Never use fresh water for wash - downs since it encourages growth of decay producing fungi .
10	142	14	Do not use strong detergents , acids , and bleaches for deck cleaning .
11	156	5	Do not sand decks .
12	161	18	c. Set up a routine of daily wetting down of wood strip planked decks with salt water .
13	179	18	This wetting down causes strip deck planking to remain swollen and creates a tighter fit between planks .
14	197	22	Wetting down is especially necessary during warm weather periods when the sun ’s heat will quickly dry out the deck planking .
15	219	15	Do not allow water to accumulate in deck recesses for any length of time .
16	234	21	d. Cover all plywood decks with a coating following the application and deck preparation procedures of reference ( b ) .
17	255	30	e. Planking renewal will be approved by the TYCOM only on the basis of a technical survey that has positively shown specific need and complete justification for such renewal .
18	285	17	Often used general terms such as " Rotten and Worn " are not considered sufficient justification .
19	302	14	The technical basis for planking renewal must be formed in the following manner :
20	316	24	( 1 ) Drill test bore holes in weather deck areas to find planking thickness in specific areas where plank wear is suspected .
21	340	39	If the planking is not worn beyond the limits set forth in reference ( b ) , the planking will not be renewed unless other extenuating and justifiable circumstances dictate , and replacement is authorized by the TYCOM .
22	379	14	( 2 ) Take boring plug samples of planking suspected of being decayed .
23	393	7	Notify the TYCOM of inspection results .
24	400	32	( 3 ) Once planking has reached the maximum wear limits ( found by bore test ) , the TYCOM will determine the need to replank or apply a deck coating .
25	432	14	f. So far as practicable , repair deck leaks by recaulking deck seams .
26	446	35	g. When deck planking wear limits have been reached , and other factors such as extensive deck leaks suggest use of a deck covering , a coating of polyurethane deck overlay may be used .
27	481	25	Non - skid material must be Naval Sea Systems Command approved material compatible with the deck overlay as defined in reference ( b ) .
28	506	19	h. Reset metallic planking fasteners when fastener heads are level with , or protrude above , deck level .
29	525	26	Where the planking level is within 1 / 4 " or less of fastener head , filling with seam filler vice wooden plugging is authorized .
30	551	24	Where bung plugs are installed , they must be set in black polyurethane seam filler per the requirements of reference ( c ) .
31	575	22	i. Ships currently having polysulfide or polyurethane coated strip deck planking in good condition must continue to use the applied covering .
32	597	18	Make minor repairs to this polyurethane coating as necessary using either a polysulfide or polyurethane repair kit .
33	615	18	When the polysulfide covering is no longer economically repairable , replace it with a polyurethane type coating .
34	633	16	Repairing cracks and holes in impervious deck coatings must be accomplished as soon as practical .
35	649	13	Failure to do so will lead to deck rot and costly repairs .
36	662	5	24.3.3 Deck Covering Repairs .
37	667	22	Interior and exterior deck covering material is prescribed by Military Specifications and will be installed only as approved by the TYCOM .
38	689	8	Repair previously installed deck coverings as necessary .
39	697	14	Reference ( b ) prescribes approved materials and preparation procedures for wooden decks .
40	711	4	24.3.4 Caulking Techniques .
41	715	18	Removal of old caulking from leaking seams and recaulking is the standard method for repairing deck leaks .
42	733	20	Fill the caulked seams with a black polyurethane seam filler , per the requirements of reference ( c ) .
43	753	10	Before filling , caulk the seams with sufficient cotton .
44	763	14	Seam out gaging ( beveling ) as specified in reference ( d ) .
45	777	28	Detailed instructions concerning equipment used , the preparation of seams , the method of application and primers to be used are described in reference ( b ) .
46	805	8	24.3.5 Weather Deck or Planked Deck Repair .
47	813	16	a. Remove all loose or decayed cotton or oakum caulking after removing all seam filler .
48	829	34	In areas where caulking is found to be in good condition , set this material deeper into the seam opening , ensuring it is driven in solidly to make room for additional caulking .
49	863	14	b. Small , tight seams will require a new single thread of cotton .
50	877	18	The size of the seam in width and depth determines the amount of cotton or oakum required .
51	895	32	Install sufficient cotton or oakum so that the level of the top of the caulking is 1 / 4 " to 3 / 8 " below the surface of the decking .
52	927	9	This will allow room for the seam filler .
53	936	36	c. Unless marine glue ( pitch ) is used as a seam filler , seal the surface of the caulked cotton or oakum with a special seam primer that is compatible with the seam filler .
54	972	12	Do not use a rubber - type seam filler over oakum .
55	984	35	d. Prime or fill newly caulked seams at the end of each day ’s caulking to keep moisture out of the caulking material and to protect the dry surface of the deck plank seams .
56	1019	27	e. Rubber type seam fillers that are installed in seams with a caulking gun must also be hand worked into the seam with a putty knife .
57	1046	13	This is necessary to eliminate air pockets and voids in the seam .
58	1059	17	Hand working of the seam filler must be in one single direction to avoid air pockets .
59	1076	5	24.3.6 Underwater Planking Repairs .
60	1081	12	a. The forward and after rabbet must receive a thorough inspection .
61	1093	30	The rabbet seam in the stern area is covered with an anchor chafe plate and is not available for inspection or repair unless the anchor chafe plate is removed .
62	1123	26	Slack or rotten caulking allows for infestation of marine burrowers and decay which , in the case of the rabbet seams forward , goes undetected .
63	1149	24	b. Inspect and test caulked plank seams covered with bottom sheathing for soundness whenever areas are exposed due to the removal of sheathing .
64	1173	21	In most cases , the seams have been covered for many years and have not been available for periodic maintenance .
65	1194	16	These seams , although covered with sheathing , do eventually waste away or become slack .
66	1210	20	The seams at the planking butts are more susceptible to slackening and erosion due to movement at the joints .
67	1230	17	Under normal conditions , it is necessary to recaulk these joints every 10 to 15 years .
68	1247	40	c. If the outer strand of oakum caulking appears to be satisfactory , then the seam may be repaired by setting the existing caulking deep into the seam and adding more strands of oakum to fill the seam depth .
69	1287	28	If the old caulking is wasted away or decayed , clean out the seam and remove all caulking and residue to make room for the new material .
70	1315	23	d. Before filling the newly caulked seam with a seam compound , paint the oakum and seam with anti - fouling paint .
71	1338	21	Painting the seam protects the oakum from marine burrowers and primes the wood in the way of the seam filler .
72	1359	22	Painting the oakum produces a hard surface finish which also makes a water barrier necessary for the protection of the oakum .
