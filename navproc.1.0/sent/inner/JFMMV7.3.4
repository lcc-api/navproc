0	0	4	5.7.4 Material Estimating .
1	4	15	a. The material estimate usually receives the least attention of all the estimates provided .
2	19	26	This may not significantly affect a small job , but the accumulation of small errors on a large package can affect the total estimate considerably .
3	45	11	When estimating material costs , the following must be considered :
4	56	16	( 1 ) The kinds and quantity of each material required to accomplish the work .
5	72	13	( 2 ) Whether the materials are procurable or will be manufactured .
6	85	13	( 3 ) The “ lead time ” for procuring the material .
7	98	9	( 4 ) Is the material commercially available ?
8	107	12	( 5 ) The current or future price for the material .
9	119	50	b. The estimator is not expected to be as familiar with the material pricing as a purchasing agent , but should be familiar with the market , should know what is scarce and what is not available from commercial sources and should keep up with current prices and availability .
10	169	21	The estimator should also use drawing material lists , equipment technical manuals and Allowance Parts Lists to determine material requirements .
11	190	25	Cost estimates are then based upon records of previous recent purchases , current Government and vendor catalogs and consultation with Government and commercial sources .
12	215	7	5.7.4.1 Contractor vs. Government Furnished Material .
13	222	14	In estimating material costs , no distinction is made between CFM and GFM .
14	236	23	All material will be priced the same way using either Government or commercial prices , whichever is most readily available and appropriate .
15	259	37	Generally speaking , because the Government purchases supplies in large lot quantities , the cost to the Government will be less than it would be to a private contractor making single item or small lot purchases .
16	296	51	For this reason , Government prices should not be used when estimating costs for CFM in a work item , however , because the allowable variance in Class F estimates is 40 percent , it is permissible to use either commercial or Government material prices for Class F material estimates .
17	347	31	This estimate should not include the cost of material to be provided as Special Program Material or Centrally Procured Material in support of the Navy Modernization Process ( NMP ) .
18	378	22	Likewise , the cost of repairable items under special turn - around programs should not be included in the work package .
19	400	23	In developing estimates for work items , a decision about CFM vs. GFM must be made before the estimate can be finalized .
20	423	11	CFM estimates are provided on the reverse side of Appendix A.
21	434	16	It is general Department of Defense policy that contractors provide all material necessary for performance .
22	450	26	That means simply that all material should be CFM except where it is in the best interest of the Government to provide material as GFM .
23	476	7	Exceptions to the CFM policy include :
24	483	42	a. Items in long supply in the Navy Supply System ( i. e. , items stocked far in excess of expected item demand ) should be provided as GFM since it would be wasteful to require contractors to buy such materials .
25	525	33	b. Items with a set shelf life that will expire before normal draw down in the supply system should be issued as GFM if such usage remains within the shelf life requirements .
26	558	11	c. Long Lead Time Material should be provided as GFM .
27	569	36	In Government procurements , items that are not commercially available within the time period after contract award and the time the contractor needs the material for production should be considered as Long Lead Time Material .
28	605	9	d. Standardization material should be provided as GFM .
29	614	19	This material is the Special Program Material and the Centrally Procured Material purchased in support of the NMP .
30	633	12	e. Material requiring Provisioning Technical Data should be provided as GFM .
31	645	20	Normally , repair material does not require Provisioning Technical Data because it is already stocked in the supply system .
32	665	19	f. Material items to be changed out under special turnaround or repairable programs should be provided as GFM .
33	684	11	g. Material for contractor work performed outside of the U. S.
34	695	19	Overseas contractors may not have ready access to materials meeting Navy specifications and are often procured as GFM .
35	714	6	5.7.4.2 Sources of Pricing Information .
36	720	23	The most important source of pricing information for ship repair material is the Navy price list for stocked supplies and repair parts .
37	743	16	This pricing information , when used in estimating , is adequate for pricing material requirements .
38	759	33	Navy stock prices should not be used for estimating the cost of CFM in work items because the cost to industry for the same repair parts and supplies can be considerably higher .
39	792	45	When the use of Navy pricing information is not appropriate or when the required pricing information is not available , the best source of current pricing information is the manufacturer or dealer who is in the business of distributing the materials or parts needed .
40	837	25	Every estimator should maintain a listing of vendors , manufacturers , distributors , etc. , that can be consulted to obtain current pricing information .
41	862	28	Where available , catalogs of pricing data should be ordered and maintained in a central repository for reference by all estimators who may require the pricing information .
42	890	25	Each RMC should maintain a library of current material pricing data for materials frequently required in typical ship repair activities estimated by the RMC .
