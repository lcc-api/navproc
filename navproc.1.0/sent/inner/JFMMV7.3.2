0	0	5	5.7.2 Developing the Estimate .
1	5	23	In the estimating process , the estimator describes in broad terms the sequence of activities required to accomplish the work being estimated .
2	28	11	Typical repair sequences are shown in Table 5 - 3 .
3	39	23	Next , each of these activities is further broken down to the lowest level of detail necessary to facilitate the estimating process .
4	62	30	For example , in Sequence B of Table 5 - 3 , the “ inspect ” activity may require a detailed inspection of a specific set of internal components .
5	92	15	Each of the inspections may require a unique set of activities and measurement criteria .
6	107	13	Thus , each component inspection could be estimated as a separate activity .
7	120	35	a. In quantifying the work required , the estimator should envision what is to be done , as in a mental time and motion construction of the physical activity required to accomplish the work .
8	155	20	Inherent in this task is a requirement that the estimator know the details of the work to be performed .
9	175	23	If the estimator is unsure of the work activities required , a knowledgeable person should be consulted to determine the applicable requirements .
10	198	24	It is essential that the correct processes , technology , tools and sequence of work activities be considered in developing a detailed estimate .
11	222	27	b. After the mental time and motion analysis is complete , the estimator prepares a detailed listing of all activities that are to be estimated separately .
12	249	15	The level of detail should reflect that level needed to support the estimating requirement .
13	264	20	Experienced estimators do not normally need to break the work down into as many activities as an inexperienced estimator .
14	284	28	In determining the activities to be considered in the estimate , it is helpful to use a check - off list of typical requirements in ship repair .
15	312	26	The estimating check - off list shown in Appendix B is provided as an example and can be modified as necessary to suit particular situations .
16	338	39	Using the check - off list will prevent inadvertent omissions of incidental support requirements for the major activities of work required , ( e. g. , assist trades , rigging , staging , temporary lighting and ventilation ) .
17	377	41	c. In developing the estimate activity list , examine each major activity in the repair sequence , shown in Table 5 - 3 , to determine whether or not a further breakdown is needed and to identify the sublevel activities .
18	418	25	Each of the new activities identified may also require further breakdown until the level of activities is detailed enough to develop a reasonable estimate .
19	443	33	d. Once all of the activities to be estimated have been identified , the estimator has to assign labor - hours for each trade and support craft needed to accomplish each activity .
20	476	15	The cost of material to support required work is also estimated for each activity .
21	491	17	The work item estimate is the sum of all labor - hours and material cost estimates .
22	508	33	Work item estimates of labor are normally expressed in terms of man - days rather than man - hours ( one man - day being equal to eight man - hours ) .
23	541	17	Labor estimates for contract modification are normally expressed in man - hours vice man - days .
