0	0	4	24.3.2 Maintenance Policies .
1	4	13	Specific maintenance policies and repair practices are described in the following paragraphs .
2	17	29	a. As a general policy , because of the ever present risk of decay developing beneath any wood coating , leave wood strip planked decks uncoated and unpainted .
3	46	16	b. Limit the cleaning of wood decks to scrubbing with mild detergents and salt water .
4	62	17	Never use fresh water for wash - downs since it encourages growth of decay producing fungi .
5	79	14	Do not use strong detergents , acids , and bleaches for deck cleaning .
6	93	5	Do not sand decks .
7	98	18	c. Set up a routine of daily wetting down of wood strip planked decks with salt water .
8	116	18	This wetting down causes strip deck planking to remain swollen and creates a tighter fit between planks .
9	134	22	Wetting down is especially necessary during warm weather periods when the sun â€™s heat will quickly dry out the deck planking .
10	156	15	Do not allow water to accumulate in deck recesses for any length of time .
11	171	21	d. Cover all plywood decks with a coating following the application and deck preparation procedures of reference ( b ) .
12	192	30	e. Planking renewal will be approved by the TYCOM only on the basis of a technical survey that has positively shown specific need and complete justification for such renewal .
13	222	17	Often used general terms such as " Rotten and Worn " are not considered sufficient justification .
14	239	14	The technical basis for planking renewal must be formed in the following manner :
15	253	24	( 1 ) Drill test bore holes in weather deck areas to find planking thickness in specific areas where plank wear is suspected .
16	277	39	If the planking is not worn beyond the limits set forth in reference ( b ) , the planking will not be renewed unless other extenuating and justifiable circumstances dictate , and replacement is authorized by the TYCOM .
17	316	14	( 2 ) Take boring plug samples of planking suspected of being decayed .
18	330	7	Notify the TYCOM of inspection results .
19	337	32	( 3 ) Once planking has reached the maximum wear limits ( found by bore test ) , the TYCOM will determine the need to replank or apply a deck coating .
20	369	14	f. So far as practicable , repair deck leaks by recaulking deck seams .
21	383	35	g. When deck planking wear limits have been reached , and other factors such as extensive deck leaks suggest use of a deck covering , a coating of polyurethane deck overlay may be used .
22	418	25	Non - skid material must be Naval Sea Systems Command approved material compatible with the deck overlay as defined in reference ( b ) .
23	443	19	h. Reset metallic planking fasteners when fastener heads are level with , or protrude above , deck level .
24	462	26	Where the planking level is within 1 / 4 " or less of fastener head , filling with seam filler vice wooden plugging is authorized .
25	488	24	Where bung plugs are installed , they must be set in black polyurethane seam filler per the requirements of reference ( c ) .
26	512	22	i. Ships currently having polysulfide or polyurethane coated strip deck planking in good condition must continue to use the applied covering .
27	534	18	Make minor repairs to this polyurethane coating as necessary using either a polysulfide or polyurethane repair kit .
28	552	18	When the polysulfide covering is no longer economically repairable , replace it with a polyurethane type coating .
29	570	16	Repairing cracks and holes in impervious deck coatings must be accomplished as soon as practical .
30	586	13	Failure to do so will lead to deck rot and costly repairs .
