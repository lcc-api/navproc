0	0	4	24.2.4 Corrective Measures .
1	4	20	a. Treat new wood , used during new construction or in repaired areas , with a copper naphthenate preservative .
2	24	17	This product is produced in a clear and colorless form or in a bright green color .
3	41	24	The green preservative has a higher level of copper and is considered to be the more durable and efficient of the two preservatives .
4	65	37	If the treated wood is to be varnished , finished with light - colored paints or left bare , use the clear preservative since the green color will bleed through varnishes and light - colored paints .
5	102	33	b. Build up a heavy concentration of the preservative with a series of three or more heavy applications using a brush , spray or immersing the wood in a preservative filled tank .
6	135	21	On - going protection requires periodic application of the preservative to bare wood structures at about five - year intervals .
7	156	9	Wood treated on this basis will last indefinitely .
8	165	34	c. Early identification of decayed areas will allow damaged wood to be treated with an anti - decay product that will harden up the soft wood and prevent the further spread of decay .
9	199	25	The product , available commercially , is a two - part mixture with deep penetrating properties that fills wood pores with a capillary action .
10	224	64	d. Before a wood structure is so badly decayed that its replacement is necessary , a possible long lasting repair is made by drilling a series of 1 / 4 " to 3 / 8 " diameter holes in and around the affected areas and gravity feeding the anti - decay mixture in sufficient quantity to allow total penetration of the damaged area .
11	288	15	A guide for proper application of this product is provided with each repair kit .
12	303	37	Avoid removing or disturbing bad wood during repairs , since the original wood , whether good or bad , serves as a container for the product and preserves the shape and size of the affected member .
13	340	13	Initial curing of the product takes place about one hour after application .
14	353	30	Total curing takes place after one week , at which time the treated wood resembles petrified wood and the growth of rot in the treated area is effectively stopped .
15	383	13	Repairs should be accomplished by Ship â€™s Force during regular maintenance periods .
