1	5	12	a. The forward and after rabbet must receive a thorough inspection .
2	17	30	The rabbet seam in the stern area is covered with an anchor chafe plate and is not available for inspection or repair unless the anchor chafe plate is removed .
3	47	26	Slack or rotten caulking allows for infestation of marine burrowers and decay which , in the case of the rabbet seams forward , goes undetected .
4	73	24	b. Inspect and test caulked plank seams covered with bottom sheathing for soundness whenever areas are exposed due to the removal of sheathing .
5	97	21	In most cases , the seams have been covered for many years and have not been available for periodic maintenance .
6	118	16	These seams , although covered with sheathing , do eventually waste away or become slack .
7	134	20	The seams at the planking butts are more susceptible to slackening and erosion due to movement at the joints .
8	154	17	Under normal conditions , it is necessary to recaulk these joints every 10 to 15 years .
9	171	40	c. If the outer strand of oakum caulking appears to be satisfactory , then the seam may be repaired by setting the existing caulking deep into the seam and adding more strands of oakum to fill the seam depth .
10	211	28	If the old caulking is wasted away or decayed , clean out the seam and remove all caulking and residue to make room for the new material .
11	239	23	d. Before filling the newly caulked seam with a seam compound , paint the oakum and seam with anti - fouling paint .
12	262	21	Painting the seam protects the oakum from marine burrowers and primes the wood in the way of the seam filler .
13	283	22	Painting the oakum produces a hard surface finish which also makes a water barrier necessary for the protection of the oakum .
