1	3	44	IO is the integrated employment , during military operations , of information - related capabilities in concert with other lines of operation to influence , disrupt , corrupt , or usurp the decision making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own .
2	47	61	For the purpose of this discussion on targeting considerations the military capabilities that contribute to IO include cyberspace operations ( CO ) , information assurance , space operations , military information support operations ( MISO ) ( formerly known as psychological operations ) , intelligence , military deception , operations security , special technical operations , joint electromagnetic spectrum operations .
3	108	23	( See Joint Publication ( JP ) 3 - 13 , Information Operations , for a broader discussion of this subject . )
4	131	6	8.11.1 General Information Operations Targeting Considerations
5	137	13	Legal analysis of intended wartime targets requires traditional law of war analysis .
6	150	43	Offensive IO can target human decision processes ( human factors ) , the information and information systems used to support decision making ( links ) , and the information and information systems used to process information and implement decisions ( nodes ) .
7	193	16	Offensive IO efforts should examine all three target areas to maximize the opportunity for success .
8	209	24	Human factors include national command authorities , commanders , forces , the populace as a whole and / or groups within the populace .
9	233	31	In all cases , the selection of offensive IO targets must be consistent with United States objectives , applicable international conventions , the law of armed conflict , and ROE .
10	264	43	Department of Defense IO activities will not be directed at or intended to manipulate audiences , public actions , or opinions in the United States and will be conducted in accordance with all applicable U. S. statutes , codes , and laws .
11	307	5	8.11.2 Physical Attack / Destruction
12	312	44	The legal requirement to attack only military objectives and to avoid excessive incidental injury / death and collateral damage to noncombatants , civilians , and civilian objects applies when identifying targets for physical attack / destruction as part of an offensive IO plan .
13	356	29	Information operations that do not entail the risk of physical injury or death to protected persons or damage to civilian objects may be targeted at noncombatants and civilians .
14	385	5	8.11.3 Military Information Support Operations
15	390	47	MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions , motives , objective reasoning , and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments , organizations , groups , and individuals in a manner favorable to the originator ’s objectives .
16	437	9	MISO must not be confused with psychological impact .
17	446	13	U. S. MISO will not target U. S. citizens under any circumstances .
18	459	4	8.11.4 Offensive Cyberspace Operations
19	463	23	Offensive cyberspace operations ( OCO ) are cyberspace operations intended to project power by the application of force in or through cyberspace .
20	486	10	OCO can be accomplished by lethal and nonlethal means .
21	496	65	In employing nonlethal means of OCO against a military objective , factors involved in weighing anticipated incidental injury / death to protected persons can include , depending on the target , indirect effects ( for example , the anticipated incidental injury / death that may occur from disrupting an electric generating plant that supplies power to a military headquarters and to a hospital ) .
22	561	44	Department of Defense doctrine describes cyberspace as a “ global domain within the information environment consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data , including the Internet , telecommunications networks , computer systems , and embedded processors and controllers . ”
23	605	24	There are no international agreements that directly address cyberspace in the context of military operations and state practice is only starting to emerge .
24	629	23	Nonetheless , if a cyber operation constitutes a military operation in an armed conflict , then the laws of armed conflict apply .
25	652	28	In particular , if a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack , then the law of armed conflict and all of its principles apply to that operation .
