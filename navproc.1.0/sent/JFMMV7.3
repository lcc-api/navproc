1	6	3	5.7.1 Preparation .
2	9	15	Estimates for labor required are limited to those direct labor categories contained in Appendix A.
3	24	26	The form was designed for use in preparing work item estimates for both competitive and noncompetitive procurements , as well as contract modifications after award .
4	50	32	In the case of estimating for a work item , the estimate is broken down by paragraph number in the work items and by Category I Standard Items , where applicable .
5	82	21	In estimating for work items , the material requirements are designated as Contractor Furnished Material ( CFM ) or GFM .
6	103	16	The form is designed to show only CFM requirements in the estimate breakdown by paragraph .
7	119	7	The GFM requirements are estimated separately .
8	126	5	5.7.2 Developing the Estimate .
9	131	23	In the estimating process , the estimator describes in broad terms the sequence of activities required to accomplish the work being estimated .
10	154	11	Typical repair sequences are shown in Table 5 - 3 .
11	165	23	Next , each of these activities is further broken down to the lowest level of detail necessary to facilitate the estimating process .
12	188	30	For example , in Sequence B of Table 5 - 3 , the “ inspect ” activity may require a detailed inspection of a specific set of internal components .
13	218	15	Each of the inspections may require a unique set of activities and measurement criteria .
14	233	13	Thus , each component inspection could be estimated as a separate activity .
15	246	35	a. In quantifying the work required , the estimator should envision what is to be done , as in a mental time and motion construction of the physical activity required to accomplish the work .
16	281	20	Inherent in this task is a requirement that the estimator know the details of the work to be performed .
17	301	23	If the estimator is unsure of the work activities required , a knowledgeable person should be consulted to determine the applicable requirements .
18	324	24	It is essential that the correct processes , technology , tools and sequence of work activities be considered in developing a detailed estimate .
19	348	27	b. After the mental time and motion analysis is complete , the estimator prepares a detailed listing of all activities that are to be estimated separately .
20	375	15	The level of detail should reflect that level needed to support the estimating requirement .
21	390	20	Experienced estimators do not normally need to break the work down into as many activities as an inexperienced estimator .
22	410	28	In determining the activities to be considered in the estimate , it is helpful to use a check - off list of typical requirements in ship repair .
23	438	26	The estimating check - off list shown in Appendix B is provided as an example and can be modified as necessary to suit particular situations .
24	464	39	Using the check - off list will prevent inadvertent omissions of incidental support requirements for the major activities of work required , ( e. g. , assist trades , rigging , staging , temporary lighting and ventilation ) .
25	503	41	c. In developing the estimate activity list , examine each major activity in the repair sequence , shown in Table 5 - 3 , to determine whether or not a further breakdown is needed and to identify the sublevel activities .
26	544	25	Each of the new activities identified may also require further breakdown until the level of activities is detailed enough to develop a reasonable estimate .
27	569	33	d. Once all of the activities to be estimated have been identified , the estimator has to assign labor - hours for each trade and support craft needed to accomplish each activity .
28	602	15	The cost of material to support required work is also estimated for each activity .
29	617	17	The work item estimate is the sum of all labor - hours and material cost estimates .
30	634	33	Work item estimates of labor are normally expressed in terms of man - days rather than man - hours ( one man - day being equal to eight man - hours ) .
31	667	17	Labor estimates for contract modification are normally expressed in man - hours vice man - days .

70	734	7	5.7.3 Quantification of the Labor Estimate .
71	741	17	a. Most work activities are estimated on the basis of the estimator ’s judgment and experience .
72	758	26	Even in the absence of experience , the estimator can still assign reasonable estimates based on good judgment and knowledge of the work being estimated .
73	784	34	By mentally going through each step of the work required , the estimator can assign a labor estimate based on judgment of the time required to accomplish each step of the work process .
74	818	19	Such detailed estimating can parallel the industrial engineering methods used to develop estimating standards for repetitive type work .
75	837	17	Industrial engineering standards are the result of comprehensive time and motion studies of a work process .
76	854	11	The time required to perform each operation is measured repetitively .
77	865	37	Through analysis , a standard is developed for each step , allowances are made for distractions and rest periods and a standard allowance is made by summing the standard for each step plus other applicable allowances .
78	902	19	In mentally paralleling this process , the estimator is providing the time for each step or motion required .
79	921	22	The estimates for each step are summed and additional allowances are added for distractions , rest periods and other possible considerations .
80	943	10	The other considerations include such items as the following :
81	953	7	( 1 ) Location of Work :
82	960	18	Estimates for a work operation should be greater when the operation is performed in a congested area .
83	978	46	For example , repairs to a water fountain in a congested machinery space with other work in progress would be more time - consuming than the same repairs to a similar water fountain located on the mess decks , in the absence of other work .
84	1024	31	Work operations of any kind are more time - consuming when performed in conjunction with other work ( mutual interference ) or when performed in a cramped or congested area .
85	1055	37	Likewise , estimates should be escalated for work performed in a hostile environment such as in tanks or voids , in poorly ventilated spaces , in hot or cold spaces , in contaminated atmospheres , etc .
86	1092	8	( 2 ) Ship ’s Force Work :
87	1100	36	When work is being performed on the same equipment or system by both the contractor work force and the Ship ’s Force , there is normally an added degree of mutual interference to be considered .
88	1136	30	Even when the two work forces are not in the same space , the mutual interference may lead to inefficiencies that should be considered in estimating the contractor work .
89	1166	6	( 3 ) Prevailing Weather :
90	1172	19	When the geographic area for an assigned availability is known , the geographic weather pattern should be considered .
91	1191	17	Likewise , if the time of year is known , the seasonal weather should be considered .
92	1208	28	For example , it is normally more costly to blast and paint the underwater body of a ship hull in below freezing weather than in milder weather .
93	1236	16	Similarly , the weather may also impact paint curing times and other time factors considered .
94	1252	8	( 4 ) Ship ’s Material Condition :
95	1260	27	Estimating Standards , historical estimates , “ Rules of Thumb ” and other estimating tools available for use are generally applicable under “ average ” conditions .
96	1287	17	Estimates for many work operations should be factored to reflect the material condition of the ship .
97	1304	15	If the ship is in average condition , the standards need not be factored .
98	1319	21	If the ship is new , then the standards should be reduced to reflect the better than average material condition .
99	1340	16	If the ship is in very poor material condition , the estimate should be increased .
100	1356	35	Not all work operations are affected by the ship ’s general material Condition ; However , many are , such as surface preparations , painting , insulation and lagging , structural repairs , etc .
101	1391	8	( 5 ) Category I Standard Items :
102	1399	25	The NAVSEA Category I SIs are invoked in work packages following the guidance provided by the Standard Specification for Ship Repair and Alteration Committee .
103	1424	25	When invoked in a job order , the provisions of the Category I SI apply for the duration of the availability without further reference .
104	1449	33	The estimator must know which Category I SI is applicable for the work and what the direct , hard - core labor cost impact of each SI is on the work required .
105	1482	33	Each time the provisions of the Category I SI are applicable in a work item , an allowance should be made to accomplish the hard - core labor requirements of the SI .
106	1515	22	An SI will be invoked if any work in the areas addressed in the SI is likely in the work package .
107	1537	16	Not all Category I SIs will have a direct hard - core labor cost impact .
108	1553	11	Those that do are discussed briefly in the following sections .
109	1564	13	( a ) SI 009 - 04 : Quality System ; provide .
110	1577	6	Invoked for all significant availabilities .
111	1583	17	This item requires the contractor to develop and use an inspection system acceptable to the Government .
112	1600	15	The contractor must develop an inspection plan for each item and record inspection results .
113	1615	46	This plan must provide for a corrective action program to correct defective or non - conforming work , maintain a calibration system for test equipment , control non - conforming material , conduct periodic quality reviews and provide notification to the Government for each CHECKPOINT .
114	1661	25	When this SI is invoked , nearly every work item should have approximately 10 percent of the effort allocated to Quality Assurance and NDT .
115	1686	15	( b ) SI 009 - 07 : Fire Prevention and Housekeeping ; accomplish .
116	1701	19	Invoked for all manned vessels , unless the Type Commander ( TYCOM ) requests SI 009 - 35 .
117	1720	26	This item requires the contractor to provide acetylene or gas supply manifold systems off the ship with shutoff valves to gas supply on the pier .
118	1746	12	This requirement should be considered in each instance of gas use .
119	1758	25	When SI 009 - 07 is invoked , approximately 25 percent of the hot work effort should be allocated for estimating fire watch requirements .
120	1783	16	( c ) SI 009 - 10 : Shipboard Asbestos - Containing Material ; control .
121	1799	15	Invoked when any machinery , piping and compartment insulation and lagging may be removed .
122	1814	26	Under this item , the contractor is required to provide a process control procedure for the control of asbestos - based insulation and lagging materials .
123	1840	18	All insulation and lagging materials are assumed to be asbestos - based until shown to be otherwise .
124	1858	28	Work accomplished must conform to Occupational Safety and Health Act requirements regarding insulation removals , work zones , protective equipment and clothing , and disposal of insulation .
125	1886	24	Compliance with these requirements is a labor - intensive operation that must be considered for each time and place the work is required .
126	1910	25	When SI 009 - 10 Is Invoked , approximately 33 percent should be added to the insulating and lagging estimate of the work item .
127	1935	17	( d ) SI 009 - 24 : Isolation , Blanking and Tagging Requirements ; accomplish .
128	1952	34	Invoked when equipment , systems , piping or circuits require isolating , blanking and tagging for safety or cleanliness and to prevent operation of a system or equipment while work is being accomplished .
129	1986	36	Under the requirements of this item , the contractor is required to comply with the Ship ’s Force system for isolation , blanking and tagging of equipment or systems in the performance of required work .
130	2022	29	The contractor has to notify Ship ’s Force in each instance of starting or completing work and a contractor representative must sign the ship ’s tag out log .
131	2051	28	Further , the contractor has to provide , install and remove blanks on piping , valves , equipment and components that are isolated or removed during performance .
132	2079	9	Items removed must be tagged with metal tags .
133	2088	9	Electrical cables disconnected must be insulated and taped .
134	2097	37	Each of these requirements requires hard - core labor for accomplishment and must be considered as part of the work activity even though not specifically spelled out in the work item ( 2 - Kilo ) .
135	2134	26	When invoked , approximately 5 percent of the trade hours should be added to the estimate to cover the requirements of SI 009 - 24 .
136	2160	15	( e ) SI 009 - 61 : Shipboard Use of Fluorocarbons ; control .
137	2175	5	Invoked for all specifications .
138	2180	25	Under this item , the contractor is required to develop and use a process control procedure to govern control of shipboard use of fluorocarbons .
139	2205	54	The contractor must notify the Government in each instance of use of fluorocarbons and must provide ventilation and telephonic communications for transfer operations , suspend hot work in spaces affected by atmospheric fluorocarbons , use at least two people for quantities in excess of 10 pounds and vent gases to ship exterior atmosphere .
140	2259	14	These requirements must be considered in all estimates involving the use of fluorocarbons .
141	2273	19	Approximately 20 percent should be added to the estimate to cover the requirements of SI 009 - 61 .
142	2292	16	( f ) SI 009 - 65 : Polychlorinated Biphenyls ( PCB ) ; control .
143	2308	5	Invoked for all specifications .
144	2313	26	Under this item , the contractor is required to develop and use a process control procedure for control , clean up and disposal of PCBs .
145	2339	15	The contractor must inspect each equipment or component containing PCBs and make a report .
146	2354	14	These requirements must be considered in any work estimate where PCBs are involved .
147	2368	25	( g ) SI 009 - 73 : Shipboard Electrical , Electronic , Fiber Optic Cable ; remove , relocate , repair and install .
148	2393	8	Invoked for all specifications requiring electrical work .
149	2401	26	Under this item , the contractor is required to remove completely all electrical cables no longer necessary due to work required in the job order .
150	2427	22	Work required includes blanking bulkhead and deck penetrations , removal of unused hangers and installation of new banding for remaining cables .
151	2449	30	Relocation of existing cables and installation of new cables requires banding , installation of hangers , deck and bulkhead penetrations and connection of cable leads to components or equipment .
152	2479	16	These requirements must be included as work activities in all work on shipboard electrical cables .
153	2495	16	( h ) SI 009 - 106 : Work Authorization and Control Process ; accomplish .
154	2511	5	Invoked for all specifications .
155	2516	19	This requires the contractor to comply with Volume IV , Chapter 10 of this manual regarding work authorization .
156	2535	36	Specifically , the contractor is required to submit a Work Authorization Form to the designated representative of the ship ’s Commanding Officer for authorization to start work on each Work Item in the Job Order .
157	2571	19	This is considered an overhead or indirect charge so no direct labor charges are included in any estimates .
158	2590	20	b. References ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) also can have significant labor impact .
159	2610	25	Appendix C is provided as a check - off list to assist the estimator in properly considering the impact of Category I Standard Items .
160	2635	25	Each of these SIs must be fully understood before an estimator can properly allow for the cost impact in performance of the work required .
161	2660	21	Those items characterized as “ labor intensive ” must have detailed estimates prepared to reflect the scope of work required .
162	2681	12	The scope of work will vary significantly from job to job .
163	2693	4	5.7.4 Material Estimating .
164	2697	15	a. The material estimate usually receives the least attention of all the estimates provided .
165	2712	26	This may not significantly affect a small job , but the accumulation of small errors on a large package can affect the total estimate considerably .
166	2738	11	When estimating material costs , the following must be considered :
167	2749	16	( 1 ) The kinds and quantity of each material required to accomplish the work .
168	2765	13	( 2 ) Whether the materials are procurable or will be manufactured .
169	2778	13	( 3 ) The “ lead time ” for procuring the material .
170	2791	9	( 4 ) Is the material commercially available ?
171	2800	12	( 5 ) The current or future price for the material .
172	2812	50	b. The estimator is not expected to be as familiar with the material pricing as a purchasing agent , but should be familiar with the market , should know what is scarce and what is not available from commercial sources and should keep up with current prices and availability .
173	2862	21	The estimator should also use drawing material lists , equipment technical manuals and Allowance Parts Lists to determine material requirements .
174	2883	25	Cost estimates are then based upon records of previous recent purchases , current Government and vendor catalogs and consultation with Government and commercial sources .
175	2908	7	5.7.4.1 Contractor vs. Government Furnished Material .
176	2915	14	In estimating material costs , no distinction is made between CFM and GFM .
177	2929	23	All material will be priced the same way using either Government or commercial prices , whichever is most readily available and appropriate .
178	2952	37	Generally speaking , because the Government purchases supplies in large lot quantities , the cost to the Government will be less than it would be to a private contractor making single item or small lot purchases .
179	2989	51	For this reason , Government prices should not be used when estimating costs for CFM in a work item , however , because the allowable variance in Class F estimates is 40 percent , it is permissible to use either commercial or Government material prices for Class F material estimates .
180	3040	31	This estimate should not include the cost of material to be provided as Special Program Material or Centrally Procured Material in support of the Navy Modernization Process ( NMP ) .
181	3071	22	Likewise , the cost of repairable items under special turn - around programs should not be included in the work package .
182	3093	23	In developing estimates for work items , a decision about CFM vs. GFM must be made before the estimate can be finalized .
183	3116	11	CFM estimates are provided on the reverse side of Appendix A.
184	3127	16	It is general Department of Defense policy that contractors provide all material necessary for performance .
185	3143	26	That means simply that all material should be CFM except where it is in the best interest of the Government to provide material as GFM .
186	3169	7	Exceptions to the CFM policy include :
187	3176	42	a. Items in long supply in the Navy Supply System ( i. e. , items stocked far in excess of expected item demand ) should be provided as GFM since it would be wasteful to require contractors to buy such materials .
188	3218	33	b. Items with a set shelf life that will expire before normal draw down in the supply system should be issued as GFM if such usage remains within the shelf life requirements .
189	3251	11	c. Long Lead Time Material should be provided as GFM .
190	3262	36	In Government procurements , items that are not commercially available within the time period after contract award and the time the contractor needs the material for production should be considered as Long Lead Time Material .
191	3298	9	d. Standardization material should be provided as GFM .
192	3307	19	This material is the Special Program Material and the Centrally Procured Material purchased in support of the NMP .
193	3326	12	e. Material requiring Provisioning Technical Data should be provided as GFM .
194	3338	20	Normally , repair material does not require Provisioning Technical Data because it is already stocked in the supply system .
195	3358	19	f. Material items to be changed out under special turnaround or repairable programs should be provided as GFM .
196	3377	11	g. Material for contractor work performed outside of the U. S.
197	3388	19	Overseas contractors may not have ready access to materials meeting Navy specifications and are often procured as GFM .
198	3407	6	5.7.4.2 Sources of Pricing Information .
199	3413	23	The most important source of pricing information for ship repair material is the Navy price list for stocked supplies and repair parts .
200	3436	16	This pricing information , when used in estimating , is adequate for pricing material requirements .
201	3452	33	Navy stock prices should not be used for estimating the cost of CFM in work items because the cost to industry for the same repair parts and supplies can be considerably higher .
202	3485	45	When the use of Navy pricing information is not appropriate or when the required pricing information is not available , the best source of current pricing information is the manufacturer or dealer who is in the business of distributing the materials or parts needed .
203	3530	25	Every estimator should maintain a listing of vendors , manufacturers , distributors , etc. , that can be consulted to obtain current pricing information .
204	3555	28	Where available , catalogs of pricing data should be ordered and maintained in a central repository for reference by all estimators who may require the pricing information .
205	3583	25	Each RMC should maintain a library of current material pricing data for materials frequently required in typical ship repair activities estimated by the RMC .
