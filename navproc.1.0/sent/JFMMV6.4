0	0	5	32.5.1.3 Ranking Matrix Calculation .
1	5	58	Data for each attribute are scaled , normalized or standardized ( depending on the language in your field of study ) in a way that creates unit vectors ( 0 to 1 , with a few high outliers > 1 ) in statistical units ( Standard Deviation multiples sometime referred to as “ Z ” scores ) .
2	63	19	The scaling used results in the 3 - sigma value of the data being scaled to equal one .
3	82	44	The 99.86 th percentile of the data is used to locate that value in the ranked raw data , which is a percentile commonly used for “ normal ” distributions with a single tail as being equivalent to the 3 - sigma value .
4	126	26	Although the five attribute distributions are not “ normal ” , they are close to being “ log normal ” so the percentile technique works .
5	152	36	The percentile technique works well regardless since the data is a 100 % sample and the statistical distribution ( which should be known if samples are used for estimating ) is not a critical issue .
6	188	31	After scaling the attributes , the vector equivalents are then combined using vector addition to create a balanced rank value that can be used for final ordering of the ranking .
7	219	10	The vector addition technique is straightforward ( Pythagorean ) .
8	229	26	For over three years this has produced a tight pattern of the top ten for each attribute falling within the top 50 fleet - wide .
9	255	24	The method is objective , repeatable , and robust and uses the “ actual data ” , not a representation of the data .
