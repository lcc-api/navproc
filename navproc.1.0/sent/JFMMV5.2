0	0	12	5.10.2 Non - Nuclear Deviations , Waivers and Departure from Specifications .
1	12	14	The terms “ deviation ” and “ waiver ” are often used synonymously .
2	26	37	However , the principle difference is a deviation is requested prior to conducting work that will result in a non - conformance , where a waiver is requested after a non - conformance has been discovered .
3	63	37	Requests for deviation and waivers must be retained and tracked within the DFS system by Ship ’s Force and the ISIC or TYCOM until permanent documentation is confirmed to reflect the specific non - conforming condition .
4	100	20	Use of the Web Based Electronic Departure from Specification or Electronic Waiver and Deviation programs facilitate meeting these requirements .
5	120	37	A DFS ( non - nuclear system or components only ) is used specifically to identify a lack of compliance with plans , procedures , instructions , or authoritative documents during a maintenance action or operations .
6	157	6	5.10.2.1 During a Maintenance Action .
7	163	15	A DFS is required for any lack of compliance with cognizant documents or drawings .
8	178	64	For an “ as found ” condition during maintenance , the TYCOM , the ship and the Regional Maintenance Center ( if involved ) must evaluate the non - compliance using the guidance of paragraphs 8.2.4 and 8.2.5 , of Part I , Chapter 8 of this volume to determine if the nonconforming condition meets the criteria as a Major or Minor DFS .
9	242	2	NOTE :
10	244	22	IF THE SHIP IS AT SEA THE GUIDANCE OF PARAGRAPH 8.3.8 OF PART I , Chapter 8 of this volume applies .
11	266	4	5.10.2.2 During Operations .
12	270	15	A DFS is required for any lack of compliance with cognizant documents or drawings .
13	285	66	For any “ as found ” conditions or equipment failures that result in a non - compliance , the ship ( or TYCOM if in port ) must evaluate the condition or failure using the guidance of paragraphs 8.2.4 and 8.2.5 of Part I , Chapter 8 of this volume to determine if the nonconforming condition meets the criteria as a Major or Minor DFS .
14	351	41	a. If the nonconforming condition does not meet the criteria as a Major or Minor DFS , no DFS is required and the nonconforming condition will be entered in the ship ’s Current Ship ’s Maintenance Project ( CSMP ) .
15	392	33	This CSMP entry must include the DFS serial number , On - Site Analysis Report serial number ( if applicable ) or other technical references documenting or tracking the non - conformance .
16	425	38	b. If a DFS is required , the request should be processed as soon as possible to enable an engineering evaluation of the non - conformance and subsequent approval or disapproval issued without disrupting ship ’s operations .
17	463	26	c. Requests for DFS will be submitted , approved and cleared per paragraph 8.3.7 or 8.3.8 of Part I , Chapter 8 of this volume .
18	489	23	Use of the Web Based Electronic Departure from Specification and Electronic Waiver and Deviation programs are acceptable unless directed otherwise by TYCOM .
19	512	40	d. If a DFS is approved as “ temporary ” and requires rework to correct the discrepant condition at a later date , a new CSMP entry for correction of the discrepant condition will be initiated by the ship .
20	552	33	This CSMP entry must include the DFS serial number , On - Site Analysis Report serial number ( if applicable ) or other technical references documenting or tracking the non - conformance .
21	585	11	The ship ’s QAO must ensure this action is accomplished .
22	596	47	e. The QAO must verify that an active Job Control Number ( JCN ) exists for all active temporary DFSs at the completion of all scheduled maintenance availabilities or at least quarterly and must ensure that an auditable record of such verification is maintained until superseded .
23	643	53	f. For all DFSs , deviations or waivers that have been adjudicated , the approving activity is required to provide a copy of the DFS , deviation or waiver to the ship ’s QAO for retention and tracking per Part I , Chapter 8 , paragraph 8.3.1 . e of this volume .
