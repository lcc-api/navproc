1	5	71	If a nuclear powered ship or nuclear capable FMA is unable to comply with specifications for reactor plant systems or components listed in enclosure ( 1 ) to reference ( g ) and also those systems identified as nuclear by the appropriate nuclear or non - nuclear interface diagram ( references ( b ) and ( c ) ) , then a review of NAVSEA 08 requirements must be requested .
2	76	35	In general , technical resolution to questions or problems for reactor plant systems or components requires use of a liaison inquiry according to the requirements of references ( b ) and ( c ) .
3	111	24	a. References ( b ) and ( c ) provide the requirements on submission of LARs for nuclear Powered surface ships and submarines .
4	135	2	NOTE :
5	137	25	LARs SUBMITTED MUST CONTAIN ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY REFERENCE ( b ) AND REFERENCE ( c ) TO ENSURE A RAPID , ACCURATE RESPONSE .
6	162	17	b. Reference ( d ) provides the requirements on submissions of LARs for nuclear support facilities .
7	179	21	c. A LAR should not be submitted for cases of out of specification seat leakage of nuclear valves after repairs .
8	200	21	The Reactor Plant Planning Yard and Reactor Plant Prime Contractors do not have the authority to waive valve leakage specifications .
9	221	38	When valve seat leakage exceeds reactor plant manual specification after attempted Ship ’s Force or FMA repairs , the following method may be used to defer rework and close out the Controlled Work Package ( CWP ) :
10	259	2	Note :
11	261	15	This alternative to satisfactory completion of retest is applicable only to valve seat leakage .
12	276	26	( 1 ) The ship must inform TYCOM ( via squadron or group for submarines ) by message with an info copy to NAVSEA 08 .
13	302	57	The message must include a Description of the initial problem , repairs conducted , seat leakage rate , leak Specification , dates of next availability , status of the following sub - paragraphs ( 2 ) through ( 5 ) , and request for authorization to continue operation with out - of - Specification seat leakage .
14	359	14	( 2 ) All hydrostatic and tightness test requirements must be satisfactorily completed .
15	373	14	( 3 ) All other portions of the CWP must be properly completed .
16	387	27	( 4 ) A new maintenance deferred action must be submitted to the ISIC for repair of the valve seat leakage at the next FMA availability .
17	414	28	( 5 ) The valve seat leakage must not constitute an operational problem ( for submarines , Group or Squadron ’s determination and justification statement required ) .
18	442	24	( 6 ) Based on Ship ’s justification statement , TYCOM will respond by message to all concerned regarding deferral of corrective maintenance .
19	466	28	After satisfactory final review , closeout of the CWP can be made with an approved deferral of Corrective maintenance in lieu of a satisfactory seat leakage test .
20	494	25	d. A liaison action file , with a sequential index and containing all submitted Nuclear LARs , must be maintained by the originating activity .
21	519	10	The file must contain a copy of LARs submitted .
22	529	28	A copy of the liaison action must be kept with liaison requests in the Answered LARs section and in the CWP or Formal Work Package if applicable .
23	557	14	e. Request for DFS for nuclear systems will be neither requested nor approved .
24	571	35	If a ship , FMA or shipyard has a question , problem or is unable to comply with nuclear specifications , request for technical resolution will be made using an LAR or Trouble Record .
