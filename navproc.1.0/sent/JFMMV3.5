33	189	49	When AFMAs visit ports with substantial Naval Repair facilities or are in commercial ports during times of high port loading , it is often desirable to divide availabilities and primary work screening functions between the shore activity and the AFMA on a ship - by - ship basis .
34	238	31	When this happens , the applicable maintenance manager will , by message , assign the primary availability and work package screening responsibility to either the shore activity or the AFMA .
35	269	14	When assigned , the primary activity will request and screen the work package .
36	283	21	The primary activity will also screen work candidates for referral to the secondary activity for review and acceptance or rejection .
37	304	21	The secondary activity will then issue its own screening message concerning only the work candidates referred by the primary activity .
38	325	11	Ports where this may be routinely expected to happen are :
39	336	1	PORT
40	337	1	activity
41	338	1	Yokosuka
42	339	3	SRF - JRMC
43	342	1	Sasebo
44	343	4	SRF - JRMC Det
45	347	21	c. The following guidance applies to work to be accomplished by all maintenance activities on ships not permanently homeported overseas :
46	368	36	( 1 ) Work candidates which are clearly within the capability of Ship 's Force will Not normally be accomplished by repair activities , but technical assistance will be provided if the need is substantiated .
47	404	40	( 2 ) Work candidates for material only or manufacture of standard stock items will not be approved , unless the item is not available in time to ensure timely correction of Casualty Reports or major safety items only .
48	444	24	( 3 ) Unless previously authorized by the Type Commander , work candidates for ship changes will not normally be approved while deployed .
49	468	34	( 4 ) Activities authorized to accomplish work screening will use screening messages prepared per Appendix A of this chapter , or via E - mail ( SIPRNET or NIPRNET ) as applicable .
