5	25	3	22.1 PURPOSE .
6	28	17	To provide Type Commander policy with respect to pressure testing submarine communication antennas and Photonics systems .
7	45	19	This policy is not applicable to periscopes , radar antennas and other non - communication masts and cabling .
8	64	10	Amplifying information is contained in reference ( a ) .
9	74	3	22.2 BACKGROUND .
10	77	21	Submarine antenna and Photonics systems associated cable connections between the antenna and electrical hull fitting are sensitive to seawater intrusion .
11	98	35	In the event that seawater enters an electrical hull fitting , radome or other powered component and the system is subsequently powered - on or used for transmission , significant component damage may occur .
12	133	3	22.3 POLICY .
13	136	5	22.3.1 Hydrostatic Pressure Testing .
14	141	37	a. Hydrostatic pressure testing of submarine antennas with cables attached prior to initial installation ( or after any maintenance actions that requires the disassembly of the antenna ) is mandatory except for buoys and floating wires .
15	178	34	This pre - installation test is intended solely to verify the correctness of the final assembly and does not equal or replace the more elaborate acceptance testing required for various individual manufactured components .
16	212	13	Submarine communications antennas that are required to be hydrostatic pressure tested are :
17	225	2	Note :
18	227	26	All oe - 538 / 592 mast are Hydrostatically tested at either the oe - 538 / 592 depot or waterfront I - level facility .
19	253	22	( 1 ) Multifunction Masts , OE - 538 ( SSNs ) and OE - 592 ( SSBNs and SSGNs ) .
20	275	2	NOTE :
21	277	25	ALL SUBHDR MASTS ARE HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED AT THE Subhdr national maintenance center ( NMC ) prior to being issued to the fleet for installation .
22	302	16	( 2 ) Submarine High Data Rate Mast , OE - 562 ( SubHDR ) .
23	318	7	b. Buoys that are excluded are :
24	325	28	( 1 ) Submarine Launched One - Way Tactical ( SLOT ) Buoys ( AN / BRT - 1 and An / BRT - 1 a ) .
25	353	28	( 2 ) Submarine Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon ( SEPIRB ) Buoy ( T - 1630 / SRT or T - 1630 A / SRT ) .
26	381	16	c. All versions of Floating wires are excluded ( i. e. Buoyant Cable Antennas ) .
27	397	2	Note :
28	399	42	The towed buoy antenna , an / Brr - 6 ( Ssbn 730 - 738 ) and the an / Brr - 6 B ( Ssbn 739 - 743 ) will be hydrostatic tested before installation according to the maintenance manual .
29	441	4	22.3.2 Fleet Maintenance .
30	445	29	Maintenance actions conducted by Fleet Maintenance Activities or Ship ’s Force regarding the watertight integrity test requirements between submarine antennas and their respective hull connectors , must be :
31	474	40	a. When the antenna or cable is disconnected or replaced shipboard , the Technical Work Document will include the following checks in the assembly procedure to reconnect the cable to the base of the antenna or electrical hull fitting :
32	514	19	( 1 ) Craftsman verification that surface finishes of O - ring seating surfaces are per applicable specifications .
33	533	18	( 2 ) Craftsman verification that the O - ring is properly installed and per applicable specifications .
34	551	35	( 3 ) For submarine SubHDR and Photonics systems outboard cable removal and replacement , accomplish per Volume V , Part I , Chapter 7 , Appendix B , NOTE 31 of this manual .
35	586	62	b. Prior to performing a deep dive certification after a maintenance action , passive testing or pre - energize testing , or both , must be performed following the system specific Technical Manual , SUBMEPP approved Maintenance Standard , SUBMEPP approved Standard Test Procedure or Maintenance Requirement Card ( MRC ) to ensure the system is not grounded prior to use .
36	648	57	c. Upon completion of a deep dive certification for a maintenance action , passive testing , pre - energize testing , or both , must be performed following the system specific Technical Manual , SUBMEPP approved Maintenance Standard , SUBMEPP approved Standard Test Procedure or MRC to ensure the system is not grounded prior to use .
37	705	3	22.4 Procedure .
38	708	31	a. Upon completion of maintenance and before underway for submerged operations , the ship must place CAUTION tags on the Main Power Switch or transmit keys for the affected antennas .
39	739	48	The Amplifying Instructions for the CAUTION tags will state - “ DO NOT OPERATE OR TRANSMIT ON THIS ANTENNA UNTIL COMPLETION OF PASSIVE CHECKS FOLLOWING A DIVE TO TEST DEPTH . PASSIVE CHECKS MUST BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH USE UNTIL THE DEEP DIVE IS COMPLETE . ”
40	787	27	b. It is understood that in some cases , due to water depth restrictions , the deep dive may not be performed for quite some time .
41	814	18	In these cases , the ship should dive to the maximum depth possible and conduct passive checks .
42	832	53	Provided the checks are satisfactory , the CAUTION tag may be replaced with one stating - “ DO NOT OPERATE OR TRANSMIT ON THIS ANTENNA FOLLOWING OPERATIONS GREATER THAN ( enter max depth obtained ) . PASSIVE CHECKS MUST BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH USE UNTIL THE DEEP DIVE IS COMPLETED . ”
43	885	45	c. The tag ( s ) may be removed following completion of a deep dive to test depth and completion of satisfactory passive testing performed following the system specific technical manuals or Maintenance Index Pages and MRCs to ensure the system is not grounded .
