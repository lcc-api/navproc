1	3	12	1 . This Compendium provides rules for the drafting of ROE .
2	15	15	The rules are divided into groups that deal with different areas of military activity .
3	30	20	Within these groups there are a number of series of rules , each of which regulates a distinct activity .
4	50	10	Individual rules are selected from the series as required .
5	60	15	Spare numbers are provided for the drafting of rules not included in the Compendium .
6	75	12	Some of the rules include the term â€• ( SPECIFY ) .
7	87	15	This means that detail must be inserted to clarify the meaning of the rule .
8	102	40	2 . The Handbook is constructed on the basis that the right to use force in individual self - defence or unit self - defence is not limited unless a rule in Groups 10 - 19 specifically does so .
9	142	23	3 . The process for drafting ROE from this Compendium is set out below and summarized in the ROE Drafting Check List .
10	165	5	a. Analyse the mission .
11	170	23	Pay particular attention to the policy , operational and legal considerations that may affect ROE , including higher authority intent or guidance .
12	193	31	Determine the character of the operation as involving armed conflict ( international or non - international ) or as falling outside armed conflict in order to determine the applicable rules .
13	224	9	b. Identify tasks from Mission Statement in OPORD .
14	233	20	The OPORD will contain the mission statement and military tasks that are to be completed to accomplish the mission .
15	253	16	These tasks need to be identified before any consideration can be given to drafting ROE .
16	269	6	c. Identify any current ROE .
17	275	11	This is necessary to determine if changes will be required .
18	286	6	d. Prepare the ROE . .
19	292	5	i. Identify Compulsory Rules .
20	297	11	The first ROE to be considered are the compulsory rules .
21	308	33	The compulsory rules deal with matters that are fundamental to any mission and must be present in every ROE , even if the rule selected is one that prohibits the military activity .
22	341	21	Every ROE is to include a rule from each of series 10 , 11 , 12 , 60 & 70 .
23	362	16	For any mission beyond self - defence , a rule from series 20 is required .
24	378	15	In situations involving armed conflict , measures from series 30 and 32 are required .
25	393	8	ii . Identify Environment - Specific Rules .
26	401	26	Appendix 2 to Annex A provides guidance for drafting ROE for environments including land , maritime , air , outer space , and cyberspace operations .
27	427	20	The rules that are most likely to be required are set out for each environment but are not compulsory .
28	447	7	iii . Identify Task Specific Rules .
29	454	35	Appendix 3 to Annex A provides guidance for drafting ROE for specific tasks including peace operations , non - combatant evacuation operations , humanitarian assistance / disaster relief , and assistance to civil authorities .
30	489	20	The rules that are most likely to be required are set out for each environment but are not compulsory .
31	509	8	iv . Review remaining rules in Compendium .
32	517	17	Each mission is unique so the environment and task specific guidance will not always be sufficient .
33	534	23	ROE drafters should check all the series in the Compendium to see if any other rules are required to accomplish the mission .
34	557	4	v. Draft rules .
35	561	13	The ROE message should be drafted with ROE listed in numerical order .
36	574	18	It is possible , and sometimes necessary , to have two rules chosen from the same series .
37	592	9	vi . Draft spare rules , if required .
38	601	14	The Compendium cannot anticipate every possible mission and rule that may be required .
39	615	35	Where a rule is not provided , it can be drafted under a spare number using the same format as Other rules in that series or as part of a new group or series .
40	650	6	vii . Determine Retained Rules .
41	656	16	Decide which rules , if any , are to be retained at a higher level .
42	672	12	These rules will remain dormant until a ROEIMP message is issued .
43	684	8	e. Validate ROE by comparing to tasks .
44	692	26	The ROE must be checked against the mission and task to ensure that it supports mission accomplishment within the limitations set out by higher authority .
45	718	6	Rectify shortfalls , if any .
46	724	4	f. Obtain approval .
47	728	9	Seek approval from the appropriate level of authority .
