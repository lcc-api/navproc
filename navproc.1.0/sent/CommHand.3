3	41	40	All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations .
4	81	10	The UN Charter provides two exceptions to this requirement .
5	91	38	First , a State may use force if authorized by a decision of the UN Security Council pursuant to its authority under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and typically documented in a UN Security Council Resolution .
6	129	53	Second , as recognized in customary international law and reflected in Article 51 of the UN Charter , force may be used in individual or collective self - defense ( see paragraphs 4.4.3 and 4.4.3.1 , for a discussion on the right of self - defense and anticipatory self - defense ) .
