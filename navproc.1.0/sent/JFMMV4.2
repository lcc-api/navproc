0	0	17	10.5 FINAL CERTIFICATION , CLOSEOUT AND RE - ENTRY OF SUBMARINE SPACES , TANKS AND VOIDS .
1	17	3	10.5.1 Purpose .
2	20	21	To establish procedures for the final certification , closeout and re - entry of submarine spaces , tanks and voids .
3	41	3	10.5.2 Discussion .
4	44	21	Historically during space , tank or void closeout , a large number of diverse and inconspicuous items have been overlooked .
5	65	18	These items have , at times , seriously degraded both material readiness and acoustic signature of submarines .
6	83	31	This section establishes a procedure to ensure a thorough certification of all spaces prior to final closeout and provides a check - off list when re - entry is required .
7	114	13	The check - off list or sheet is not all - inclusive .
8	127	20	Common sense and effective use of personnel experience and knowledge must be used to ensure complete and thorough inspections .
9	147	42	A review of references ( g ) , ( h ) and ( i ) should be performed to determine if a formal report of unscheduled visual inspection is required to be submitted for tank and voids being entered or closed .
10	189	15	Non - steel damping and acoustic restraining covers are not required to be painted .
11	204	5	Accidental overspray is acceptable .
12	209	16	Full paint out of damping restraining covers and acoustic tile covers is not the intent .
13	225	37	If damping and acoustic tiles are painted , they must be checked to ensure that the paint will not bridge the gap between the rubber and the restraining cover more than 75 % over an area .
14	262	9	Degradation of the performance of tiles is possible .
15	271	30	A suggested way to repair the area is to score the gap between the restraining cover and the damping tile and between the acoustic tile covers and the rubber .
16	301	9	Previously painted serviceable tiles may remain in service .
17	310	9	Reference ( g ) allows paint on piping .
18	319	1	NOTE
19	320	17	APPENDIX G MAY BE USED AS AN AID FOR ENTERING SUBMARINE SPACES , TANKS AND VOIDS .
20	337	3	10.5.3 Action .
21	340	19	a. The Damage Control Assistant ( DCA ) is designated the coordinator for the closeout of all spaces .
22	359	10	As such , he is responsible for the following :
23	369	20	( 1 ) Assigning responsible personnel to closeout or assist in closing out specific Spaces , tanks and voids .
24	389	26	( 2 ) Providing personnel designated to conduct tank , void , or space closeouts with a copy of Appendices G or H as applicable .
25	415	17	( 3 ) Ensuring personnel performing closeouts are aware of their responsibilities and are adequately trained .
26	432	18	He must provide , by periodic notice , a list of personnel qualified to perform closeout inspections .
27	450	12	( 4 ) Maintaining a folder for completed copies of Appendix H.
28	462	15	This folder will serve as a space , tank and void closeout certification record .
29	477	14	Only the most recent copies of these Appendices are required to be retained .
30	491	22	This folder should also include an index of all spaces , tanks and voids applicable to closeout certification and their status .
31	513	23	( 5 ) Keeping the Commanding Officer and the Engineer Officer informed as to the status of closeouts and significant deficiencies noted .
32	536	15	b. Personnel performing tank , void and space closeout or entry are responsible for :
33	551	12	( 1 ) Obtaining a copy of Appendix G and Appendix H.
34	563	12	( 2 ) Forwarding to the DCA completed copies of Appendix H.
35	575	1	NOTE
36	576	42	A REVIEW OF REFERENCES ( G ) , ( H ) AND ( I ) SHOULD BE PERFORMED To determine if a formal report of unscheduled visual inspection is required to be submitted for tanks and voids being entered or closed .
37	618	15	c. Responsibility for Re - Entry Controls ( REC ) and final certification are :
38	633	43	( 1 ) In cases where entry is required to be made for production work by both Ship ’s Force and FMA personnel , the FMA will be responsible for REC and Ship ’s Force will be responsible for final certification closeout .
39	676	31	( 2 ) For cases where only FMA work is anticipated , the FMA will be responsible for REC and Ship ’s Force will be responsible for final certification closeout .
40	707	37	For the cases in which only the maintenance activity has access ( e. g. , waterborne entry into mud tanks or ballast tanks by divers ) the maintenance activity will be responsible for final certification closeout .
41	744	27	( 3 ) For cases where only Ship ’s Force work is anticipated , Ship ’s Force will be responsible for REC and final certification closeout .
42	771	3	10.5.4 Applicability .
43	774	11	All SSN , SSBN and SSGN Class submarines and FMAs .
