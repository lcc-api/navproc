2	24	8	a. Routine and Pre - Availability Inspections .
3	32	16	( 1 ) Once during the unit ’s cycle , not to exceed 24 months .
4	48	11	The normal interval between routine diesel inspections is 18 months .
5	59	32	Routine and Pre - Availability Inspections may be performed as early as 12 months or as late as 24 months to allow for maximum scheduling flexibility and utilization of assessment findings .
6	91	47	The TYCOM , Immediate Superior in Command ( ISIC ) and other Fleet Maintenance Managers must ensure the Routine and Pre - Availability Inspection is scheduled to allow adequate time prior to availabilities to utilize the inspection and assessment results to plan work on the diesel .
7	138	20	As per reference ( a ) , in no case must the interval between Routine Inspections exceed 24 months .
8	158	22	A Routine or Pre - Availability Inspection normally consists of all three phases as discussed in paragraph 4.3.4 of this chapter .
9	180	43	For Emergency Diesel Generators ( EDG ) onboard nuclear powered vessels , industrial activity work on the diesel engine ( s ) or its support systems will not normally be approved except during a Chief of Naval Operations ( CNO ) Availability .
10	223	41	The TYCOM or ISIC must ensure that adequate upkeep time is made available prior to the availability to ensure there are a sufficient number of diesel engines with no outstanding discrepancies to provide the required standby power during the availability .
11	264	12	( 2 ) For Submarine CNO Availabilities greater than six months .
12	276	30	( a ) The Pre - Availability Inspection must be integrated into the Shipyard ’s work definition period and must be considered the material health assessment for the EDG .
13	306	28	( b ) SUBMEPP must enter this Pre - Availability Inspection in the applicable 000 - Series SWLIN as a material health assessment assigned to Forces Afloat .
14	334	47	( c ) The DEI must include the Executing Shipyard ( Code 260 ) and the Supervisor of Shipbuilding or NAVSEA Shipyard Representative ’s Office , as applicable , on distribution for all DEI reports conducted as a Pre - Availability Inspection or during the availability .
15	381	30	( d ) As Lead Maintenance Activity , the executing shipyard will work with the TYCOM to assign all deferred inspection deficiencies to the appropriate repair activity for repair .
16	411	27	( e ) The Shipyard ’s technical review of this inspection report may satisfy the Pre - Availability technical assessment requirement of reference ( c ) .
17	438	8	b. Post Casualty or Pre - Overhaul .
18	446	39	When major internal engine malfunctions have occurred or are suspected ( e. g. , crankcase explosion , major bearing , blower or crankshaft failure ) , or there are indications that the engine is in need for overhaul .
19	485	20	Extent of disassembly or inspection is at the discretion of the DEI based on the casualty or observed indications .
20	505	24	For Post Casualty Inspections , the DEI must determine the full extent of damage and the cause , along with recommendations for repairs .
21	529	26	For Pre - Overhaul Inspections , the TYCOM may require the DEI confirm that an overhaul is required and determine the scope of the overhaul .
22	555	25	Partial inspections do not satisfy the requirement for a complete Routine Inspection and this fact will be annotated in the DEI ’s written report .
23	580	6	c. Post Overhaul or Repair .
24	586	15	When an engine has been overhauled or significant maintenance or repair has been completed .
25	601	17	A Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection must be conducted by a DEI prior to continuous operation .
26	618	25	The DEI will make the final determination of whether the overhaul or repair was extensive enough to warrant a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection .
27	643	39	The inspection must consist of a review of actions taken to complete the overhaul or repair , external visual inspection , tests of safety devices , review of required readings or clearances and a Phase III operational test .
28	682	37	Unless there are indications of internal discrepancies , Phase II ( internal inspection ) is waived and the Routine Inspection periodicity requirement in paragraph 4.3.2 . a of this chapter will be considered complete and valid .
29	719	21	The Post Overhaul or Repair inspection should be an integral part of the overhaul or repair vice a separate inspection .
30	740	26	Specifically , the Phase III operational test should be part of the final operational testing of the overhaul or repair vice a separate operational test .
31	766	49	( 1 ) For contractor accomplished work , the contractor specification will contain requirements for the contractor to document required readings or clearances on applicable forms and have appropriate check points made by a DEI or Industrial Subject Matter Expert ( SME ) during the overhaul or repair .
32	815	52	If there is evidence of poor workmanship , use of improper parts , discrepancies in reassembly or test documentation or missing information as part of the repair process or during the inspection , the DEI or Industrial SME will advise the Repair Project Manager of the quality issues and required actions .
33	867	17	The Repair Project Manager will coordinate required actions with the RMC Technical Authority and Maintenance Team .
34	884	28	The RMC must liaise with the TYCOM and obtain TYCOM concurrence on all required actions and must advise the TYCOM of all potential cost and schedule impacts .
35	912	33	( 2 ) For Ship ’s Force or Fleet Maintenance Activity accomplished engine overhauls , a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection will be conducted by a DEI prior to starting the engine .
36	945	18	The scope of the inspection will be as specified in paragraph 4.3.2 . c of this chapter .
37	963	24	Commanding Officer ( or designated representative ) permission is required to perform Phase II ( internal inspection ) when requested by the DEI .
38	987	8	d. New Construction ( Acceptance Inspection ) .
39	995	23	( 1 ) Prior to the delivery of a newly constructed ship , when requested by the Board of Inspection and Survey .
40	1018	25	An acceptance inspection will normally be conducted in conjunction with the open - and - inspect phase of Board of Inspection Survey acceptance trials .
41	1043	13	The acceptance inspection does not satisfy the requirements of a routine inspection .
42	1056	23	( 2 ) The initial Routine Inspection on a new construction unit must occur prior to initial startup by Ship ’s Force .
43	1079	20	The cognizant Supervisor of Shipbuilding should incorporate the DEI as part of the Government Test Plan or Acceptance Plan .
44	1099	26	The cognizant Supervisor of Shipbuilding must notify the DEI for new construction acceptance test prior to Ship ’s Force accepting responsibility of the diesel engine .
45	1125	24	This will ensure that an inspection baseline is established and construction discrepancies are identified and corrected early in the life of the unit .
46	1149	30	( 3 ) For submarine and CVN construction programs , the initial Routine Inspection on a new construction unit must occur prior to initial startup by Ship ’s Force .
47	1179	57	For ships with temporary systems in place or less than 95 percent load available , the Phase I ( see paragraph 4.3.4 a of this chapter ) and Phase II ( see paragraph 4.3.4 b of this chapter ) inspections must occur in conjunction with crew Operational Control Transfer including an operational test at available load .
48	1236	25	The Phase III ( see paragraph 4.3.4 c of this chapter ) inspection must occur prior to ship delivery when sufficient loading is available .
49	1261	20	Any as found conditions requiring corrections must be adjudicated via the normal shipyard Operational Control Transfer inspections adjudication process .
50	1281	17	The routine diesel inspection periodicity must commence upon completion of all three diesel engine inspection phases .
51	1298	9	e. Reactivation of Engines in Inactive Equipment Maintenance .
52	1307	16	Prior to the first operation of engines which have been placed in Inactive Equipment Maintenance .
53	1323	56	The inspection consists of a complete review of the administrative records associated with the diesel engine including : actions taken to place the engine in and out of lay - up status , a review of repairs accomplished since the last inspection , visual inspection , test of safety devices and an engine performance test .
54	1379	21	If sufficient load cannot be attained , a 1 - hour operational test at maximum available load must be accomplished .
55	1400	22	Based on the administrative review and visual inspection , further internal inspections may be accomplished at the discretion of the DEI .
56	1422	20	This inspection should be requested far enough in advance of the first key event requiring use of the diesel .
57	1442	19	This will ensure any significant discrepancies found can be corrected prior to the start of the key event .
58	1461	30	This inspection does not satisfy the requirements of a routine inspection as per paragraph 4.3.2 . a of this chapter unless a complete 3 - phase inspection is accomplished .
59	1491	48	If a complete 3 - phase inspection is not accomplished and administrative , visual and operational inspections are satisfactory , the reactivation inspection report letter or cover letter should provide revised dates for the next required inspection that account for the time in Inactive Equipment Maintenance status .
60	1539	53	The revised date for the next routine inspection must be equal to the completion date of the previous routine diesel inspection plus the number of whole months the engine was in Inactive Equipment Maintenance status plus 12 , 18 and 24 months respectively for the earliest , normal interval and latest dates .
