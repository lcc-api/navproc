requirements per references (a) and (b).  Serve as a voting member to the Fleet TMDE
- METCAL Working Group.

b. Review Fleet Forces Allowance Change Requests and forward to the TMDE
Allowance Manager.  TMDE Allowance Managers are TYCOM for aviation
activities, SSP for TRIDENT activities and NAVSEA 04 for all remaining activities.

c. Redistribute excess TMDE.  Aviation activities and TRIDENT activities will follow
the guidance of NAVAIR and SSP respectively in redistributing TMDE.  The Atlantic
and Pacific Fleets will use the Consolidated TMDE Readiness Assessment (CTRA)
Program.



                                           

      

d. Provide properly trained personnel to authorized calibration activities for the repair
and calibration of assigned TMDE.  Manage assigned calibration standards and
calibration laboratories and FCAs per reference (a) and the guidance provided by the
appropriate Systems Command (SYSCOM).  Coordinate with the appropriate
SYSCOM during pre-commissioning to verify if Establishment of Field Calibration
Activity Request has been submitted and approved per reference (a).

e. Perform Quality Assurance reviews of laboratories and ensure compliance with this
instruction and appropriate SYSCOM instructions.

f. Budget and manage funds to support calibration overflow for calibration support
beyond the capability of RMC, RCC, TYCOM and shipboard calibration activities.

g. Ensure that Regional Loan Pools (RLP) are established in RMC and RCC.
h. Coordinate with NAVSEA 04RM34 for Sub-Category (SCAT) assignments and

Ship’s Portable Electrical and Electronic Test Equipment Requirements List
(SPETERL) revisions.

i. Assist Fleet Commander representatives in managing the Fleet TMDE and METCAL
programs.

j. Assist platforms with their Departure From Specification (DFS) requests and
coordinate approval of DFSs that require NAVSEA Technical Warrant Holder (TWH)
approvals.

9.2.3  NAVSEA Technical Authority.
a. The NAVSEA METCAL TWH is the Technical Authority for all equipment and

systems under the NAVSEA technical cognizance.
b. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Corona Division is the TWH’s Engineering

Agent (EA) for metrology and calibration.  NSWC Corona performs acceptance tests
for new equipment for induction into the METCAL program, sets and modifies
calibration intervals for non-installed TMDE and publishes metrology-associated
documents such as the Naval Calibration Activity List and the Metrology
Requirements List (references (f) and (g)) following SYSCOM directives.  NSWC
Corona may be contacted by telephone or message for resolution of urgent technical
problems related to calibration standards or Instrument Calibration Procedures.

c. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia Division, (NSWCPD) is the TWH’s EA
for all shipboard installed instrumentation.  NSWCPD determines shipboard
instrumentation calibration workload (cal “YES” or “NO”) by applying the principles
of Reliability-Centered Maintenance, sets and modifies calibration intervals for
shipboard instrumentation and systems, develops and validates associated calibration
procedures and publishes related calibration documentation such as ship-specific
Calibration Requirements Lists (CRL), calibration procedures that are issued via the
Planned Maintenance System (PMS) (Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRC)), and
System Calibration Procedures (SCP) following NAVSEA directives (see paragraph
9.7 of this chapter).  NSWCPD may be contacted by telephone or message for
resolution of urgent technical problems related to calibration of shipboard
instrumentation, calibration PMS or SCPs.



                                           

      

d. Naval Air Warfare Center, China Lake is the TWH EA for TMDE, prepares
specifications for new TMDE and makes technical recommendations to the TMDE
Program Manager on what instruments are listed in the TMDE Index.  Seal Beach
Detachment may be contacted by telephone or message for resolution of urgent
technical problems related to all Navy TMDE.

9.2.4  Immediate Superior In Command.
a. Monitor calibration readiness status within their respective organizations, especially

ships in a pre-deployment status.  Forward requests for assistance to the TYCOM
METCAL Manager.

b. Monitor the effectiveness of Shipboard Gage Calibration Program (SGCP) FCAs.
c. Ensure that ships with FCAs extend their service to other ships in company, as

appropriate, to reduce cost and turn-around time of calibration.
d. Ensure that each ship with an FCA has all the necessary standards, documentation and

trained personnel to maintain current certification.
e. Coordinate resolution of calibration problems found by the TYCOM designated

support activity for assigned ships.
f. (Submarine Force only) Ensure each activity actively supports the TYCOM

Calibration Program of Record by maintaining at least 95% accomplishment rate for
all TMDE in its inventory.  The TYCOM Calibration Program of Record readiness
reports will be used to monitor the accomplishment rates.

g. (Submarine Force only) Support and participate in the TYCOM’s CTRA process.
Ensure corrective actions resulting from the conduct of a CTRA are completed for
activities under the Immediate Superior In Command’s (ISIC) cognizance.

9.2.5  Commanding Officers All Forces.
a. The Commanding Officer has the overall responsibility for METROLOGY and the

Calibration Program under their cognizance and will maintain a high degree of
calibration readiness. Calibration Readiness Goal for all forces is 85%.

b. Appoint in writing, a calibration coordinator and test equipment manager responsible
for all matters related to the calibration of ship’s TMDE.  Separate coordinators may
be appointed for electronic and mechanical equipment.

9.2.6  Commanding Officers Naval Air Force.  Naval Air Force activities must also follow the
detailed procedures outlined in reference (j) for TMDE management and for operation of the
consolidated FCA.
9.2.7  Regional Maintenance Center Metrology and Calibration Coordinators.
a. Coordinate and schedule off-ship calibration or repair services for ships within their

geographic area of responsibility.  Specific lack of capability is the only justification
for off-ship calibration.

b. Maintain close liaison with the RMC and RCC shipboard calibration coordinators,
ISIC and TYCOM to prevent or resolve calibration scheduling and readiness
problems.



                                           

      

c. Review ship’s calibration work requests to ensure that TMDE within the calibration
capability of the ship’s FCA are not sent to a higher-level calibration laboratory.

d. Contact all deploying ships that have not delivered a pre-deployment calibration work
package at least 45 days before deployment to determine ship’s requirements.

e. Notify TYCOM METCAL Managers, as applicable, of all changes in RMC or RCC
calibration capability.

f. Assist RMC or RCC calibration laboratories in obtaining calibration or repair services
for laboratory standards.

g. Identify TMDE calibration requirements beyond the technical capability of the RMC
or RCC.  Coordinate with TYCOM METCAL Managers for scheduling of TMDE
overflowed to an approved calibration laboratory.

9.2.8  Regional Maintenance Center and Regional Calibration Center.
a. Calibrate and repair TMDE including calibration standards assigned by the RMC

METCAL Coordinators.  Document all calibration actions using the METBENCH
Calibration Management System (MCMS), Metrology Automated System for
Uniform Recall and Reporting (MEASURE) or the TYCOM directed data collection
method.

b. Ensure that electronic TMDE submitted by the Fleet is standard test equipment listed
in reference (h).  Contact the submitting activity and the TYCOM METCAL Manager
when non-standard TMDE is submitted for calibration.  Non-standard TMDE will not
be calibrated or repaired unless approved by the TYCOM.

c. Ensure all laboratory standards are properly calibrated at the lowest appropriate level.
Notify the TYCOM METCAL Manager of any lost or reduced laboratory capability.

d. Ensure all TMDE repaired by the RMC or RCC are completely recalibrated before
being returned to service.  Calibration of a repaired instrument will serve as Quality
Assurance of an accomplished repair.

e. Prepare and submit Calibration Problem Reports to NSWC Corona for assistance or
guidance concerning calibration problems encountered during operation of the
calibration laboratory.

f. Refer to Section 9.5 of this chapter for replacing malfunctioning calibration standards
certified by a repair facility to be Beyond Economical Repair (BER), (i.e., having a
repair cost in excess of 50% of the replacement cost).
