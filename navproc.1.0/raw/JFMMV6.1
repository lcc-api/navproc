shipboard system maintenance to the fullest extent possible.  If unable to resolve a technical
problem internally, or by other means available within their Strike Group, the ship will contact
the Navy 311, who will route their request to the cognizant Area RMC.  In the case where the
applicable RMC representatives or Other Source of Support SMEs are onboard and available,
ships may engage onboard SMEs for immediate support and will follow up with Navy 311 or the
Area RMC.  If personnel are not onboard, ships will contact Navy 311 or the Area RMC using
the following procedures to request FTA:
