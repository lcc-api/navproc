7.2 Safety Belts and shoulder harnesses

Each persons safety belt and shoulder harness shall be worn and tightened prior to takeoff and shall be worn until
completion of the flight except when necessary activities require temporary removal. Inertia reels, where provided,
shall be manually locked for all takeoffs and landings and at all other times when high g forces may be encountered
except where the procedure is detrimental to safe operation. The number of persons over 2 years of age embarked
in a naval aircraft for flight shall be restricted to the number for which there are adequate seats and safety belts. During
takeoffs, landings, and at other times as specified by the pilot in command, each person over 2 years of age on board



             

                       

transport aircraft shall occupy a seat or berth and be secured with the safety belt provided for that purpose. Cabin
seating requirement for C-2/COD aircraft, helicopters and tiltrotors may be eliminated when operational environment
or aircraft configuration/load requirements dictate for the accomplishment of essential training and operations with
the following guidelines:

a. Applies to SPECOPS training and missions.

b. Applies to dedicated lifesaving efforts, including humanitarian and SAR operations.

c. Not to be used for routine operational training or personnel transfers. Applies only when tactical or procedural
requirements exist for a specific mission or exercise.

d. When seats are removed, passengers will be restrained by an appropriate alternate means.

e. If mission profile requires removal of seats/seatbelts/restraints for one part of the mission, then passengers will,
if possible, use seats/seatbelts/restraints for all other phases of the mission.

Walkaround belts do not provide impact protection; therefore, use of those
belts shall be restricted to only those occurrences when mission
accomplishment requires persons to be out of their seat. Such belts shall not
be worn when strapped into a seat.

Note
Flight personnel leaving their seats to open a hatch or work in the
vicinity of an open hatch shall wear an approved crewman aircraft belt
(walkaround) during time spent out of the seat.
