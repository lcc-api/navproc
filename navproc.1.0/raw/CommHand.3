5.1.1 Law Governing When States Can Legally Use Force

The present-day legal framework for the jus ad bellum is found in the Charter of the United Nations. Article 2(4)
of the UN Charter provides:

All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the
territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the
Purposes of the United Nations.

The UN Charter provides two exceptions to this requirement. First, a State may use force if authorized by a
decision of the UN Security Council pursuant to its authority under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and typically
documented in a UN Security Council Resolution. Second, as recognized in customary international law and
reflected in Article 51 of the UN Charter, force may be used in individual or collective self-defense
(see paragraphs 4.4.3 and 4.4.3.1, for a discussion on the right of self-defense and anticipatory self-defense).

In addition to the two UN Charter exceptions, military action in the territory of another State is not a violation of
the Article 2(4) prohibition where that State consents to such military action.
