2.2 Warships

2.2.1 Warship Defined

International law defines a warship as a ship belonging to the armed forces of a State bearing the external
markings distinguishing the character and nationality of such ships, under the command of an officer duly
commissioned by the government of that State and whose name appears in the appropriate service list of officers,
and manned by a crew that is under regular armed forces discipline. Warships maintain their status even if
civilians form part of the crew. Ships need not be armed in order to qualify as warships. In the U.S. Navy, those
ships designated “USS” are “warships” as defined by international law. U.S. Coast Guard vessels designated
“USCGC” under the command of a commissioned officer are also “warships” under international law.



                                       

            

During international armed conflict at sea, warships are the only vessels that may exercise belligerent rights,
which include the right to conduct offensive attacks. Other vessels, such as auxiliary vessels and merchant
vessels, are not entitled to conduct attacks in offensive combat operations in an international armed conflict. All
vessels, however, may defend themselves (including resisting attacks by enemy forces). These limitations do not
apply to non-international armed conflicts.

2.2.2 Warship International Status

As a matter of customary international law, warships enjoy sovereign immunity from interference by the
authorities of States other than the flag State. Police and port authorities may board a warship only with the
permission of the commanding officer. A warship cannot be required to consent to an onboard search or
inspection, nor may it be required to fly the flag of the host State. Although warships are required to comply with
coastal State traffic control, sewage, health, and quarantine restrictions instituted in conformance with the
UNCLOS, a failure of compliance is subject only to diplomatic complaint or to coastal State orders to leave its
territorial sea immediately. Moreover, warships are immune from arrest and seizure, whether in national or
international waters, and are exempt from foreign taxes and regulation and exercise exclusive control over all
passengers and crew with regard to acts performed on board. U.S. Navy policy requires warships to assert the
rights of sovereign immunity.

2.2.3 Crew Lists and Inspections

U.S. policy prohibits providing a list of crew members (to include military and nonmilitary personnel) or any
other passengers on board a USS or USCGC vessel as a condition of entry into a port or to satisfy local
immigration officials upon arrival. For more information concerning U.S. policy in this regard
see CNO WASHINGTON, DC 071719Z JUL 16 (NAVADMIN 158/16).

It is U.S. policy to refuse host government requests to conduct inspections of U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels,
conduct health inspections of crew members, provide specific information on individual crew members (including
providing access to a crew member’s medical record or the completion of an individual health questionnaire), or
undertake other requested actions beyond the commanding officer’s certification. In response to questions
concerning the presence of infectious diseases on visiting U.S. Navy ships, the U.S. diplomatic post may inform
host governments that a commanding officer of a U.S. Navy ship is required under Navy Regulations to report at
once to local health authorities any condition aboard the ship which presents a hazard of introduction of a
communicable disease outside the ship. The commanding officer, if requested, may certify that there are no
indications that personnel entering the host State from the ship will present such hazard.

2.2.4 Quarantine

Article 0859, U.S. Navy Regulations, 1990, requires that the commanding officer or aircraft commander of a ship
or aircraft comply with quarantine regulations and restrictions. While commanding officers and aircraft
commanders shall not permit inspection of their vessel or aircraft, they shall afford every other assistance to
health officials, U.S. or foreign, and shall give all information required, insofar as permitted by the requirements
of military necessity and security. To avoid restrictions imposed by quarantine regulations, the commanding
officer should request free pratique (clearance granted a ship to proceed into a port after compliance with health or
quarantine regulations) in accordance with the sailing directions for that port.

2.2.5 Nuclear-Powered Warships

Nuclear-powered warships and conventionally powered warships enjoy identical international legal status.
