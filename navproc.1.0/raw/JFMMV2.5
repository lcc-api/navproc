3.2.11  Foreign Governments.  RMCs or FMAs may interact with foreign Governments, when
requested and authorized by the CNO or NAVSEA, to procure commercial repair work to:
a. Recondition and otherwise repair Navy ships that are to be, or have been, transferred

to foreign Governments.
b. Effect emergency voyage repairs or other services for vessels of foreign Governments,

when approved and authorized by CNO.  Request authorization using sample message
of Appendix A.  CNO may reply with sample C in Appendix B or other message
format.



                                           

          

c. Unless specific legal authority to price on other than a full cost basis, DoD services
and materials must be priced on a full cost basis per Volume 12, Chapter 9 of
reference (b).  In order to accomplish this requirement, it is critical the RMC or FMA
accurately identify and accumulate direct and indirect cost.  Full cost basis requires
that the RMC or FMA accumulate all costs associated with the maintenance effort.
This includes all direct costs that are normally captured as well as a portion of the
indirect cost.  In a situation like this, if the system for capturing cost is not accurate,
the RMC or FMA may recoup more or less than the cost incurred and if it were
Discovered later, a refund or additional bill would have to be issued.
