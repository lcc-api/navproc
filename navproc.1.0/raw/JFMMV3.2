3.4.1  Surface Force Ship and Aircraft Carrier Policy.
a. VR work package screening guidelines in reference (c) limit the type of work which

may be accomplished using overseas shipyards or Ship Repair Facilities - Japan
Regional Maintenance Center (SRF-JRMC) to VRs only.  For the purpose of this
prohibition, a shipyard is any facility that repairs naval vessels and is located outside
the United States or its territories.  VRs include only mission or safety essential items
necessary for a ship to deploy or continue on its deployment.  Only work which falls
within these boundaries will be authorized for VR accomplishment.  All other work
will be deferred.

b. VR work screening activities provide the results of screening to customer ships in a
screening message.  Approved work candidates are forwarded to the cognizant
Regional Maintenance Center (RMC) for accomplishment or contract award.  After
authorized jobs are received by the RMC, the following steps take place:

(1) RMC Surveyor accomplishes shipcheck as ship schedule permits.
(2) Cognizant RMC Surveyor writes work specifications or contract work

specifications prior to ship arrival.
(3) RMC or Contractor ship-checks take place upon ship’s arrival.  For VR that

Must be contracted, competitive bidding constraints require not less than three
contractors be considered for contract award if possible.

(4) When VR contracting is required, contract award occurs not later than arrival
plus one day.

c. Voyage Repair Availability Execution.
(1) The assigned Ashore Ships Maintenance Manager and Ship Superintendent or

Surveyor will meet ship on arrival and will ensure the Job Order Specification
or contract is in place, as applicable.  The assigned Ashore Ships Maintenance
Manager and Ship Superintendent or Surveyor will ensure the Job Order
Specification or technical portion of the contract is adhered to and provide
liaison with the local industrial activity on technical matters.  It is the RMC
Ship superintendent or Surveyor and Ship’s Force responsibility to ensure the
activity performing the VR complies with work specifications.

(2) Where applicable, the Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Naval Regional
Contracting Detachment (NRCD) representative will award the contract and
provide liaison with the contractor on contractual matters, including new work
and payment.

(3) A pre-production meeting will be scheduled, after the contractor shipcheck.
Purpose is for assigned Ashore Ships Maintenance Manager and Ship



                               
           

       

Superintendent or Surveyor to review with the Ship’s Force, contents of the
Job Order Specification or Contract Specification, ship-contractor coordination
requirements (if applicable), Quality Assurance (QA) requirements of Ship’s
Force and repair activity performing the VR, and list of government furnished
material to be provided by the ship.  The ship should provide the RMC Ship
Superintendent or Surveyor a list of the ship’s Quality Assurance Inspectors
(QAI) to be used during the VR period.

(4) Daily Production Meeting.  The Ship’s Maintenance Management Officer,
Surveyor, and other essential personnel will meet daily to review progress,
discuss daily production efforts, and remove possible “interferences” with the
intent of minimizing length of the availability.  Early and frequent
communication between all parties involved in the repair and maintenance
process will help to ensure the overall success and effectiveness of any
availability.

d. Growth and New Work.
(1) Growth work identified during the open and inspect phase of the baseline

repairs will be reviewed for cost and schedule impacts and incorporated in the
work package by the RMC assigned Port Engineer or Surveyor, as applicable.
No growth work or new work is authorized to commence until FLC NRCD
negotiates with the contractor and the appropriate contract documentation is
issued.

(2) New work must be processed and authorized without violating Public Law
restrictions.  To assure these restrictions are not violated, the ship must submit
an OPNAV 4790/2K following the normal process and provide a copy to the
assigned Ashore Ships Maintenance Manager or Surveyor.  Continuous
Screening process will ensure that the forward maintenance activity receives it
in a timely manner.  The Surveyor must determine the feasibility of completing
new work and must obtain the required authorization from the cognizant
organization (FDRMC Naples, FDRMC Det Bahrain, COMLOG WESTPAC,
SRF-JRMC).

e. Constructive changes are changes to contracts in the intent of work specifications
directed at the contractor by anyone other than the surveyor or FLC-NRCD
representative.  Since they are not pre-negotiated with the contractor, constructive
changes are against the law.  Ship’s Force personnel should be cautioned not to direct
or otherwise influence contractor personnel to accomplish work not clearly delineated
by contract specifications.

f. Contractor Limitations.
(1) Military Specification material may be available from SRF-JRMC or

requisitioned by the SRF-JRMC for contractor VR conducted on ships inport
Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan.

(2) With the exception of lagging, Military Specification parts and material are not
available to local contractors in other ports.  Some parts can be manufactured,



                               
           

       

But the material and parts required for work package execution should be
provided by the ship.

CAUTION: The ship should provide only the parts required by
work specifications.  With the exception of Yokosuka
and Sasebo, Japan, drawings and technical manuals are
generally not available in theater.  Ship’s force
should be prepared to produce associated technical
information as required.

g. Schedule Restrictions.  Ships in VR should support the workweek schedule provided
by local contractors to make the most productive use of personnel resources during the
maintenance period.

(1) In the COMFIFTHFLT AOR, the Arab work week is Saturday through
Wednesday with the weekend being on Thursday and Friday.

(2) Contractor ability to accomplish work is sometimes limited by Port Captain
regulations, and local strikes.  Although generally short term in nature, the
FLC-NRCD representative and RMC surveyor should be notified immediately
of any indication of problems.

h. Ship’s Force QA responsibilities during VRs for work performed by non-Navy
Maintenance Activities.

(1) Planning.  Increased emphasis is required by Ship’s Force to identify the level
of control of maintenance of systems being worked and proper equipment,
Allowance Parts List, technical manuals and drawings.  Early identification of
controlled work or work requiring Material Identification and Control or
Material Identification Code (MIC)-LEVEL I material, per Volume V of this
manual, will assist RMC Surveyors in producing correct work specifications.

(2) Execution.  Although the name implies quick repairs, VRs require no less
stringent QA procedures than any other routine planned repair.  While Ship’s
Force is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the QA level is maintained on
all repairs, regardless of who performs the work, the RMC overseeing the VR
is responsible to Ship’s Force to ensure all required specifications are met.
Ship’s Force QA responsibilities during execution include:

(a) Witnessing all tests and inspections specified in the contract work
specification.  Witnesses must be qualified QAIs who are aware of the
technical requirements to be fulfilled by the test or inspection.  For
steam systems, final inspections will consist of two steps:  unlagged
and lagged.

(b) Ensuring that documentation of each contractor test or inspection is
provided to the QAI at its conclusion.  If not provided, the QAI will use
the applicable form from Volume V, Part I, Chapter 11 of this manual
to document the test or inspection.  Records of all Ship’s Force and
contractor tests and inspections will be maintained per Volume V, Part
I, Chapter 10 of this manual.



                                           

       

(c) Insisting on verbatim compliance with the work specification, through
the QAI, during the test or inspection.  The QAI will immediately
inform the Department Head of any discrepancies noted.

(d) Ensuring that any material provided by Ship’s Force by direction of the
work specification is in strict accordance with technical requirements.

(e) Ensuring that no other material, tools, or physical assistance is provided
to the contractor unless it is specifically required by the contract
specification.  The entire Ship’s Force will be briefed on this prior to
the start of the VR period.

(f) Providing continual in-process inspections of work being accomplished
aboard ship.  In-process inspections of work accomplished off-ship will
be accomplished as deemed necessary by the Department Heads and as
agreed to by the RMC Surveyor.

(g) Providing ship-specific operating and design system parameters to aid
in determining actual testing requirements.  Reporting specified test
results on appropriate QA forms to the RMC Surveyor prior to the end
of the VR period.

(h) Providing all MIC LEVEL I material required to the RMC Surveyor.
Material will not be accepted unless properly controlled by Ship’s
Force.  A face-to-face turnover by a designated Controlled Material
Petty Officer to the RMC Surveyor is required.

i. RMC Quality Assurance and Quality Control responsibilities during VR availabilities.
(1) An RMC Surveyor will be present on the site of the VR for the duration of the

availability.  The RMC Surveyor will be the sole point of contact between
Ship’s Force, FLC-NRCD and the contractor for all questions and actions
concerning work specifications.

(2) The RMC Surveyor will assist Ship’s Force in QA monitoring of each job.
The surveyor will:

(a) Provide a working copy of the work specifications and all
modifications to be used for each job to the ship availability
coordinator prior to job start or as soon as they are developed.

(b) Brief the ship availability coordinator and ship supervisory personnel
on the nature of the industrial environment and the need to insist on
verbatim compliance with the job specification by the contractor,
stressing that failure of the contractor to provide required material,
perform required tests, or otherwise conform to the specification
requirements of the work, should be reported immediately.  The
briefing will specify that Ship’s Force will not obligate the government
or diminish the requirements of the work specification by direct
interface with the contractor personnel on any level.



                                           

       

(c) Identify in the work specifications all tests and inspection check points
which require Ship’s Force witness or participation.

(d) Identify in the work specifications all tests which the ship must
complete.  Provide test parameters.  If operational design and test
information are not available or are unclear, the RMC will request
assistance from the Type Commander (TYCOM).

(e) Identify in writing the specifications for material to be provided by the
ship to the contractor.

(f) Inspect all material to be turned over to the contractor by Ship’s Force
for controlled work with the designated Ship’s Force QAI.  If the
controlled material is MIC-Level I, the material inspection must be a
joint inspection, to include the designated Ship’s Force QAI and the
Ship’s Controlled Material Petty Officer, prior to a turnover of the
material to the contractor.

(g) Inspect each completed controlled work job with the designated Ship’s
Force QAI prior to final acceptance.

(h) Advise the ship availability coordinator of any condition where the lack
of references, Military Specification material, or qualified contractor
personnel will require Ship’s Force submission of a Departure from
Specification per Volume V, Part I, Chapter 8 of this manual.

j. Post-Production Meeting.  The RMC Surveyor will provide to Ship’s Force all
appropriate documentation, including objective quality evidence, to verify the VR was
satisfactorily completed.  As necessary, technical justification will also be provided
when a Departure from Specification request is required to be submitted.

k. Following the completion of the VR Availability, Ship’s Force must generate and
transmit a Post-VR Assessment Report for transmission via message or e-mail.
