2.6.10 Conduct of NATOPS Reviews

a. The NATOPS Model Manager’s designated representative (normally the NATOPS Program Manager) shall act
as chairperson. The chairperson shall establish the Review schedule based on the size and complexity of the
agenda. Agenda items may be addressed in any logical sequence. The NATOPS Products Administrator (AIR
4.0P Airworthiness Directorate) shall make the determination of any voting procedures other than those
specified herein.

b. Minimum Review attendance shall include the NATOPS Products Administrator (AIR 4.0P Airworthiness
Directorate), the COG Command representative, any Advisory Group member exercising operational control
of the subject aircraft, the NAVAIR APMSE representative, COMNAVSAFECEN, and all NATOPS evaluation
units for the subject aircraft. Additional attendees shall be invited by the MMU as indicated in the convening
message.



             

            

c. The formal voting membership shall be limited to direct representatives of advisory group members, the
APMSE, the MMU, and in some cases NATOPS evaluation units. Each voting command represented shall be
limited to one vote and no individual shall have more than one vote. Designation of a representative from
another command to vote and act for a voting member who cannot attend the Review shall be done in writing.
Votes may be cast in absentia only if made in writing.

d. Agenda items that involve changes to policy shall not be introduced at the Review if not provided to all voting
members in sufficient time for staffing prior to the Review.

e. Discussion should be free and relatively informal. However, the chairperson shall exercise the authority to
discontinue discussion when it is no longer profitable. The chairperson may call for an immediate vote on an
item, defer voting on the agenda item pending receipt of additional information, or refer it to a committee for
further study. It is often advantageous to appoint committees to consider specific agenda items or to review
Supplementary publications such as classified supplements and checklists.

f. The model manager shall ensure a comprehensive record of the Review agenda and items discussed, their
disposition, and the reasons for the decision to approve or disapprove each agenda item is kept.

g. Careful planning by the program manager is the key to a successful and efficiently conducted Review. Physical
arrangements must include sufficient space for joint sessions and for committee meetings as required.
Appropriate reference material and extra copies of the publication(s) being reviewed should be available.
Clerical assistance should be provided by the MMU to maintain a daily record of Review discussion. The
editorial production contractor support may assist with these tasks, if available.

h. Approved agenda items that require expeditious incorporation are designated in the Review report as advance
change items, which are then issued as Interim Changes for incorporation into the NATOPS publications.
Advance change items should be agreed upon by the review formal voting membership. Liaison between the
NATOPS Program Manager and the NATOPS Products Administrator (AIR-4.0P Airworthiness Directorate)
prior to the Review report being finalized is strongly recommended, both to ensure that Advance Change Items
are recorded optimally, and to enable preparation of the Interim Change so that it is ready to be issued when the
Review report arrives. The NATOPS Products Administrator (AIR-4.0P Airworthiness Directorate) will release
the interim change following receipt of the NATOPS Review report.

i. Certain agenda items may require additional technical review following the Review. The NATOPS Products
Administrator (AIR-4.0P Airworthiness Directorate) and the NAVAIR APMSE shall be responsible for
ensuring adequate engineering review is completed prior to the Review freeze date for any such items.

2.6.10.1 NATOPS Program Manager’s Quick Reference Guide

The NATOPS Program Manager Quick Reference Guide (QRG) provides an in-depth discussion of the NATOPS
program and shall be thoroughly reviewed by the NATOPS Program Manager prior to the convening of the Review.
The QRG is available on the Airworthiness website (https://airworthiness.navair.navy.mil).
