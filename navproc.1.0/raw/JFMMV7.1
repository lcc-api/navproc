2.10  PROCESSING CONTRACTUAL ACTIONS.
2.10.1  Policies.  This section discusses policy concerning the processing of the more common
contractual actions.
2.10.2  Forward Price Rate Agreement.  A Forward Price Rate Agreement (FPRA) is a written
agreement negotiated between a contractor and the Government to make certain rates available
during a specified period for contractual actions.  Such rates represent reasonable projections of
specific costs that are not easily estimated for, identified with or generated by a specific contract,
contract end item or task.  These projections may include rates for labor, indirect costs, material
obsolescence and usage, spare parts provisioning and material handling.  Negotiation of FPRAs
may be requested by the Contracting Officer, the contractor or initiated by the ACO.  In
determining the need for an FPRA, the ACO should evaluate whether the benefits from the
agreement are worth the effort of establishing and monitoring it.  FPRAs should only be
negotiated with contractors having a significant volume of Government contract proposals.  The
responsible RMC must determine whether to establish an FPRA.  Indirect costs commonly
defined as overhead are defined and described in reference (u) including treatment and
application of indirect costs to contracts.
2.10.3  Pricing of Deleted Work.  Deletions should be based on the reasonable value of the
change at the time the work would have been performed.  The deletion values should not be
based on itemized estimates provided by the contractor at the time of contract award.  The
deletion value should include all costs reasonably associated with the deleted work, including
profit.
2.10.4  Awarding Job Orders.  The Government uses the sealed bidding and negotiation methods
of contracting in awarding contracts, including job orders.  These methods of contracting are
covered in detail in references (j) and (k).
2.10.5  Objective of Procurement Process and Contract Pricing.  The objective of the
procurement process is to acquire supplies and services of the desired quality in a timely manner
at “fair and reasonable” prices.  The objective of contract pricing is to establish and administer
an arrangement that poses a fair and reasonable price for delivery of a product or service.
2.10.6  Pricing Responsibility.  The Contracting Officer is responsible for exercising proper
judgment and is solely responsible for the final pricing decision.  Although the Contracting
Officer is responsible for the final pricing decision, the Contracting Officer is not expected to
perform all functions leading to the contractual document’s execution.  Although the
recommendations and counsel of contributing specialists, including auditors, are advisory only,
the Contracting Officer should include comments in the price negotiation memorandum when
significant auditor or other specialists’ recommendations are not adopted.
2.10.7   Adjudications on the Basis of Estimates.  NAVSEA policy requires changes to be
adjudicated on the basis of estimates.  Adjudications must not be deliberately delayed to allow
the determination of actual incurred costs from which to adjudicate.
