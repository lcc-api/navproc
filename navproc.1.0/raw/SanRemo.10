Maritime warning zone announcements

5.1   Maritime Warning Zones are an operational issue. Properly established and
Appropriately Implemented maritime warning zones provide operational commanders with
the means to enhance the self-defence and force protection posture of their assets, and with
the means to announce potential hazards to other users of the water space. However used,
Maritime warning zones cannot and do not absolve commanders of their responsibility for
the safety of the forces they command or for their duty to comply with LOAC and other rules
of international law.

5.2   Maritime Warning Zones are typically announced through a Notice to Mariners
(NOTMAR), Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), or similar announcement.

5.3   Model announcements are provided for two types of zones:


a.   Warning Area in International Waters.

b.   Warning Area and Exclusion Zone in the Territorial Sea.


5.4   Where the term  (SPECIFY)  is included, detail must be inserted to clarify the
meaning of the provision.
