24.1  PURPOSE.  This chapter contains procedures for the inspection, repair and maintenance of
wood decks and structures on wood-hulled ships and craft.
24.2  Wood decay.
24.2.1  Primary Causes.  Wood decay is caused by a fungus growth which breaks down the cell
structure within the wood.  This fungus thrives in fresh water but its growth is significantly
retarded by salt water.  Wood decay generally occurs in those spaces which are poorly ventilated
and where fresh water has gained access.  Poor drainage, allowing fresh water to stand, even in
small amounts, is particularly hazardous.  The primary causes of wood decay found in ships
using wood for hulls, decking and structures are identified as:
a. Insufficient ventilation and air circulation especially in spaces plagued by dampness

and high humidity (i.e., chill room platforms and areas around fresh water tanks).
b. Obstructed drainpipes, scuppers, limbers, and drain holes.
c. Uncaulked or poorly maintained deck seams, especially around plywood decking and

Deckhouse areas.
d. Washing down with fresh water.
e. Depressions in the deck from sanding which allows fresh water to stand.
f. Leaking plumbing especially in heads, water closets, and food preparation areas.
24.2.2  Recognition.  Decay in the deck and hull structure is often concealed and hard to detect.
It is usually not recognizable by visible fungus except in joints between surfaces.  Decay may be
suspected if paint coating is discolored or the wood surface is cupped.  The affected wood has a
pronounced stringy, fibrous appearance.  Thoroughly decayed wood is brittle which, when dry,
breaks easily across the grain with a distinct brash fracture and may crumble into powder.  Black
stains spreading along the grain from ferrous metal fastenings are usually a result of chemical
reactions instead of from decay fungi.  Testing procedures for suspected decay areas are detailed
in reference (a).
24.2.3  Preventive Measures.  Detailed preventive measures are described in reference (a).
General preventive measures for the reduction of wood decay are identified in the following
paragraphs, and should be accomplished by Ship’s Force.



                                           

       

a. Correct or remove all interference with complete water runoff.
b. Repair fresh water leaks in plumbing drains and fresh water supply systems.
c. Maintain ventilation system in proper operation.  Ensure ventilation system filters are

Kept clean, maintained clear of all foreign material, and ventilation terminals remain
open.

d. Carefully caulk and maintain deck seams, especially around plywood decking,
deckhouse, hull fittings and foundation areas.

e. In fair weather, open hatches and deck plates to supplement the air circulation.
f. Remove wet dunnage or shoring in below deck spaces and permit to dry.
g. Avoid washing down with fresh water.  Use only salt water due to its preservation

Values.
h. Wash down the ship or craft with salt water following periods of inclement weather to

eliminate fresh water and restore salt washed away by the rainfall.
i. Avoid heavy buildup of paint.
j. Check MCM bilges and accessible voids for standing fluids once each watch.  Identify

and correct any leaks and promptly remove any fluids.  MCMs are designed to operate
with dry bilges.  Prolonged contact with fluids will result in wood swell, which can
lead to external glass reinforced plastic delamination, planking damage, and
machinery misalignment.

24.2.4  Corrective Measures.
a. Treat new wood, used during new construction or in repaired areas, with a copper

naphthenate preservative.  This product is produced in a clear and colorless form or in
a bright green color.  The green preservative has a higher level of copper and is
considered to be the more durable and efficient of the two preservatives.  If the treated
wood is to be varnished, finished with light-colored paints or left bare, use the clear
preservative since the green color will bleed through varnishes and light-colored
paints.

b. Build up a heavy concentration of the preservative with a series of three or more heavy
applications using a brush, spray or immersing the wood in a preservative filled tank.
On-going protection requires periodic application of the preservative to bare wood
structures at about five-year intervals.  Wood treated on this basis will last indefinitely.

c. Early identification of decayed areas will allow damaged wood to be treated with an
anti-decay product that will harden up the soft wood and prevent the further spread of
decay.  The product, available commercially, is a two-part mixture with deep
penetrating properties that fills wood pores with a capillary action.

d. Before a wood structure is so badly decayed that its replacement is necessary, a
possible long lasting repair is made by drilling a series of 1/4" to 3/8" diameter holes
in and around the affected areas and gravity feeding the anti-decay mixture in
sufficient quantity to allow total penetration of the damaged area.  A guide for proper
application of this product is provided with each repair kit.  Avoid removing or



                               
           

       

disturbing bad wood during repairs, since the original wood, whether good or bad,
serves as a container for the product and preserves the shape and size of the affected
member.  Initial curing of the product takes place about one hour after application.
Total curing takes place after one week, at which time the treated wood resembles
petrified wood and the growth of rot in the treated area is effectively stopped.  Repairs
should be accomplished by Ship’s Force during regular maintenance periods.

24.3  Deck and hull maintenance.
24.3.1  Inspection Requirements.  With reasonable care, wood-hulled ships can give many years
of economical service.  Make frequent inspections to detect any leaks beneath the covering
board, around the deckhouse areas and seams in the deck planking.  Reference (a) lists general
maintenance requirements for wood-hulled ships.
24.3.2  Maintenance Policies.  Specific maintenance policies and repair practices are described in
the following paragraphs.
a. As a general policy, because of the ever present risk of decay developing beneath any

wood coating, leave wood strip planked decks uncoated and unpainted.
b. Limit the cleaning of wood decks to scrubbing with mild detergents and salt water.

Never use fresh water for wash-downs since it encourages growth of decay producing
fungi.  Do not use strong detergents, acids, and bleaches for deck cleaning.  Do not
sand decks.

c. Set up a routine of daily wetting down of wood strip planked decks with salt water.
This wetting down causes strip deck planking to remain swollen and creates a tighter
fit between planks.  Wetting down is especially necessary during warm weather
periods when the sun’s heat will quickly dry out the deck planking.  Do not allow
water to accumulate in deck recesses for any length of time.

d. Cover all plywood decks with a coating following the application and deck
preparation procedures of reference (b).

e. Planking renewal will be approved by the TYCOM only on the basis of a technical
survey that has positively shown specific need and complete justification for such
renewal.  Often used general terms such as "Rotten and Worn" are not considered
sufficient justification.  The technical basis for planking renewal must be formed in
the following manner:

(1) Drill test bore holes in weather deck areas to find planking thickness in specific
areas where plank wear is suspected.  If the planking is not worn beyond the
limits set forth in reference (b), the planking will not be renewed unless other
extenuating and justifiable circumstances dictate, and replacement is
authorized by the TYCOM.

(2) Take boring plug samples of planking suspected of being decayed.  Notify the
TYCOM of inspection results.

(3) Once planking has reached the maximum wear limits (found by bore test), the
TYCOM will determine the need to replank or apply a deck coating.

f. So far as practicable, repair deck leaks by recaulking deck seams.



                                           

       

g. When deck planking wear limits have been reached, and other factors such as
extensive deck leaks suggest use of a deck covering, a coating of polyurethane deck
overlay may be used.  Non-skid material must be Naval Sea Systems Command
approved material compatible with the deck overlay as defined in reference (b).

h. Reset metallic planking fasteners when fastener heads are level with, or protrude
above, deck level.  Where the planking level is within 1/4" or less of fastener head,
filling with seam filler vice wooden plugging is authorized.  Where bung plugs are
installed, they must be set in black polyurethane seam filler per the requirements of
reference (c).

i. Ships currently having polysulfide or polyurethane coated strip deck planking in good
condition must continue to use the applied covering.  Make minor repairs to this
polyurethane coating as necessary using either a polysulfide or polyurethane repair kit.
When the polysulfide covering is no longer economically repairable, replace it with a
polyurethane type coating.  Repairing cracks and holes in impervious deck coatings
must be accomplished as soon as practical.  Failure to do so will lead to deck rot and
costly repairs.

24.3.3  Deck Covering Repairs.  Interior and exterior deck covering material is prescribed by
Military Specifications and will be installed only as approved by the TYCOM.  Repair
previously installed deck coverings as necessary.  Reference (b) prescribes approved materials
and preparation procedures for wooden decks.
24.3.4  Caulking Techniques.  Removal of old caulking from leaking seams and recaulking is the
standard method for repairing deck leaks.  Fill the caulked seams with a black polyurethane seam
filler, per the requirements of reference (c).  Before filling, caulk the seams with sufficient
cotton.  Seam out gaging (beveling) as specified in reference (d).  Detailed instructions
concerning equipment used, the preparation of seams, the method of application and primers to
be used are described in reference (b).
24.3.5  Weather Deck or Planked Deck Repair.
a. Remove all loose or decayed cotton or oakum caulking after removing all seam filler.

In areas where caulking is found to be in good condition, set this material deeper into
the seam opening, ensuring it is driven in solidly to make room for additional
caulking.

b. Small, tight seams will require a new single thread of cotton.  The size of the seam in
width and depth determines the amount of cotton or oakum required.  Install sufficient
cotton or oakum so that the level of the top of the caulking is 1/4" to 3/8" below the
surface of the decking.  This will allow room for the seam filler.

c. Unless marine glue (pitch) is used as a seam filler, seal the surface of the caulked
cotton or oakum with a special seam primer that is compatible with the seam filler.
Do not use a rubber-type seam filler over oakum.

d. Prime or fill newly caulked seams at the end of each day’s caulking to keep moisture
out of the caulking material and to protect the dry surface of the deck plank seams.

e. Rubber type seam fillers that are installed in seams with a caulking gun must also be
hand worked into the seam with a putty knife.  This is necessary to eliminate air



                               
           

       

pockets and voids in the seam.  Hand working of the seam filler must be in one single
direction to avoid air pockets.

24.3.6  Underwater Planking Repairs.
a. The forward and after rabbet must receive a thorough inspection.  The rabbet seam in

the stern area is covered with an anchor chafe plate and is not available for inspection
or repair unless the anchor chafe plate is removed.  Slack or rotten caulking allows for
infestation of marine burrowers and decay which, in the case of the rabbet seams
forward, goes undetected.

b. Inspect and test caulked plank seams covered with bottom sheathing for soundness
whenever areas are exposed due to the removal of sheathing.  In most cases, the seams
have been covered for many years and have not been available for periodic
maintenance.  These seams, although covered with sheathing, do eventually waste
away or become slack.  The seams at the planking butts are more susceptible to
slackening and erosion due to movement at the joints.  Under normal conditions, it is
necessary to recaulk these joints every 10 to 15 years.

c. If the outer strand of oakum caulking appears to be satisfactory, then the seam may be
repaired by setting the existing caulking deep into the seam and adding more strands
of oakum to fill the seam depth.  If the old caulking is wasted away or decayed, clean
out the seam and remove all caulking and residue to make room for the new material.

d. Before filling the newly caulked seam with a seam compound, paint the oakum and
seam with anti-fouling paint.  Painting the seam protects the oakum from marine
burrowers and primes the wood in the way of the seam filler.  Painting the oakum
produces a hard surface finish which also makes a water barrier necessary for the
protection of the oakum.

24.4  Surface preparation and painting.
24.4.1  General Techniques.  The greatest single factor affecting the performance of any paint
system is the method and care used in the preparation of the surface to be coated.  The
preservation of wooden ships presents some unique problems not encountered in other types of
ships.  Reference (e) provides guidance for surface preparation materials and methods of
application, techniques, and general safety precautions for painting.
24.4.2  Preparation and Painting Policies.  Specific TYCOM policies pertaining to the
preparation and paint application are identified in the following paragraphs:
a. The use of torches to blister the existing paint coating for removal is authorized;

however, care must be taken to guard against damage to other items or equipment in
the vicinity.  Avoid application of heat on or near items such as electric wiring,
plastics, gaskets, and all flammable materials.  Use only enough heat as required to
blister the paint.  Excessive heat chars the wood fibers and removal of the charred
wood results in an uneven surface.  Remove all interferences that can reasonably be
removed before applying heat.  This includes all label plates, brackets, clips, etc.

b. Scraping tools used to remove blistered paint must be kept sharp to be effective.  Do
all scraping in the direction of the wood grain to prevent shredding of wood fibers and



                               
           

       

gouging of the bare wood surface.  This phase of paint removal is important in
preparing the surface for sanding.

c. All areas stripped as previously described are now ready for sanding before priming.
Hand sanding, with wooden blocks where practicable, using the correct grit paper, is
the prescribed final step.  Careful dusting before paint application is absolutely
necessary to achieve a good primer bond, or bond between subsequent paint coats.

(1) Power disc sanders are not authorized for use in surface preparation.  Improper
use of the disc sander is the biggest cause of uneven surfaces and damage.

(2) Belt sanders and vibrating sanders are authorized for use in preparing the hull
freeboard for priming and top-coating.

24.5  WOODEN HULL BOTTOM SHEATHING.  For bottom sheathing to be effective and to
provide protection to the underlying hull planking, the sheathing must fit the shape of the
vessel’s contoured bottom, be securely fastened, and be faired to the level of adjoining pieces of
sheathing.  The sheathing must be installed per the requirements of reference (a).
a. Sheathing the bottoms of wood vessels serves to protect the hull from burrowers,

especially if the vessels are to endure long periods between dry-dockings.
b. For vessels that are active and are dry-docked annually, the use of sheathing is not

Required.
24.6  WOODEN SEA CHEST FOUNDATIONS.
a. To prevent overheating of the wood filler blocks and wood cap blocks in sea chests,

the wood must be insulated from the metal fittings.  Use of delron sleeves or bushings
around the body of the through-hull fitting and around the bolt fastenings is one
Approved method.

b. A Cathodic Corrosion Control system using an impressed current through anodes
installed on boat bottoms isolates the anode fittings with the use of delron bushings
and by the application of a mastic material applied over bare wood in a 36” diameter
Area around the anode.

c. Replace wood fillers and caps that are badly decayed.  If repairs cannot be made
immediately, then treat the bad wood with a preservative or decay inhibitor to slow up
the rate of deterioration until the bad wood can be replaced.  When new fillers in the
Form of blocks and caps are fabricated, they should be treated with preservative prior
to installation and after the wood has been finally shaped and fitted.
