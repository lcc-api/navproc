3.3.3  Pre-Reactor Safeguard Examination (Nuclear Powered Ships only).
a. Purpose.  To evaluate the readiness of the Engineering or Reactor Department to

undergo an RSE by representatives of Naval Sea Systems Command Nuclear
Propulsion Directorate (NAVSEA 08).  Appendix C of this chapter provides a sample
Pre-RSE Notice which should be tailored to fit your specific platform.

b. Conduct.  The Pre-RSE performed by the ISIC with TYCOM assistance is not
intended to duplicate the inspections for which readiness is being evaluated.  It is
prudent, however, to use an inspection plan similar to that employed by NAVSEA 08.
Normally the crewâ€™s readiness can be assessed within two days using such a plan.  The
Supervising Authority will arrange for minimum industrial activity work interference
during this inspection.

c. Scheduling.  The ISIC must conduct a Pre-RSE within six weeks of intended
criticality.  The Pre-RSE will be scheduled such that the qualification program and
material condition of the ship are sufficiently complete to allow for a thorough
inspection, but early enough to allow time for the correction of identified deficiencies
prior to criticality.  The TYCOM should be advised approximately two months prior
to the tentative date and confirmed dates should be established approximately one
month prior to the inspection.

d. Composition of the Inspection Team.  The Pre-RSE Inspection Team should consist
of:

(1) A nuclear trained member of the ISIC Staff, usually the Deputy Commander
for Readiness or Training.

(2) A qualified nuclear engineer with experience in the billet.
(3) A nuclear trained officer from the TYCOM Staff.  Arrangements for the

participation of TYCOM Staff members should be initiated by the ISIC at least
one month prior to the anticipated inspection date.

(4) The Prospective Commanding Officer (PCO) of the next local ship in a new
construction status.

(5) The TYCOM industrial activity representative.
e. Reports.  The Senior Inspector should provide the ship with an informal report of the

findings with a copy to the ISIC and TYCOM.
f. Inspection Areas.  The Pre-RSE should, as a minimum, encompass the following:
(1) An administrative review.



                                           

     

(2) Observation of basic drills and evolutions not requiring reactor operation or
special conditions.

(3) Personnel interviews and written tests.
(4) Material inspection.
