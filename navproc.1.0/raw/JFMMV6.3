Instructions for maintaining the submarine
battery record book

Navsea 9320/1 (3-92)

1. GENERAL.  Accurate battery records are an absolute requirement.  These records enable
Reviewing activities to identify problem areas or to change the scheduled battery replacement
based on the performance of a particular battery installation.  These records provide the data
necessary to complete NAVSEA form 9320/3, Submarine Battery Quarterly Report.  Therefore,
proper maintenance of the BRB is essential.
2. INSTRUCTIONS.
a. Remarks Section:  This section should include information of a general nature.

Information such as the following should be included:  Date and manner of
Installation; Lifting of a cell for examination and results thereof, electrolyte “spiking”
to include reason for action, quantities involved, authority granted, etc.; Initial pilot
Cells selected, as well as any change of pilot cells; Any change, transfer or removal of
cells; Pertinent data concerning the isolation of cells; Completion of battery
Manufacturers recommendations from battery inspection reports; Other abnormal or
unusual information that is pertinent to the battery.  The following should not be
included in the remarks section:  waterings; two ohm load checks; PMS checks; water
purity test results performed by Ship’s Force; battery well inspections or other
Information of a repetitive nature unless different or unusual conditions exist.

b. Electrolyte Analysis Section:
(1) Laboratory - enter the name of the laboratory where the analysis was

Performed.
(2) Serial or file number of report - enter the number assigned to the report by the

Laboratory.
(3) Date - the date on which the sample was taken from the cell (vice the date the

analysis was performed by the laboratory).
(4) Cells analyzed - enter the battery cell number from which the sample was

Drawn.
(5) Remarks - enter either satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on the analysis

record.  If unsatisfactory, enter the reference covering the action taken.
NOTE: THE “DATE” AND “CELLS ANALYZED” INFORMATION SHOULD BE

Entered immediately after the sample is drawn.  All
other information should be entered upon receipt of the
laboratory report.

c. Equalizing Charge Data Section:
(1) Date - enter the date on which the equalizing charge was commenced.  (This

should match the date on the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6)).



                                           

                   

(2) Charge number - enter the charge number for the equalizing charge being
logged.

(3) Average SG - for all nuclear submarines, the average SG of the battery (all
battery cells in the circuit) following the equalizing charge is recorded in Block
1.  (This should never be the pilot cell averages, but an average of the entire
battery.)  Block 2 will only be used on diesel submarines.

(4) Cells - list all cells with a SG greater than or equal to ten points (0.010 SG)
above or below the battery average SG.  List the following:  cell number,
corrected SG of the cell, corrected ICV.  If no cells are beyond the ten-point
parameter, write “None”.

d. Summary of Test Discharges and Trial Runs:
(1) Date - enter the date in which the test discharge was performed.
(2) Battery rate including average auxiliary load - capacity test discharges are

conducted at the three-hour rate for all submarine battery types.  The discharge
rates for each battery type are:

Guppy 1, Mod E (ASB-49) 2400 amps (three hr rate)
TRIDENT (PDX-57) 3450 amps (three hr rate)
SEAWOLF (LLL-69) 2600 amps (three hr rate)
(3) Limiting voltage allowed - enter the total battery voltage limit and the ICV

limit allowed for the discharge rate maintained (as noted in the Battery Rate
block).  These values are noted in reference (a) for each battery type and
Discharge rates.

finish of the test discharge cycle in the appropriate block.  (Round to whole
Number).

(5) Required length of discharge corrected for temperature - enter the rated length
of time (in minutes) to attain 100% capacity.  This value must be corrected for
temperature.  Temperature corrections are accomplished utilizing the
applicable Curve and Data table contained in reference (a).  The average
temperature of the pilot cells is used in the temperature correction.  For
example:  If pilot cell temperatures are 83°F and 86°F, average temperature
equals 84.5°F.  This number is rounded to 85°F.  Required length of discharge
for the 3-hour rate would be 182.5 minutes.  This number is rounded to 183
Minutes.

(6) Discharge maintained - enter the actual time (in whole minutes).  This will be
the duration of the discharge to the limiting voltage (either total battery
voltage, ICV or average ICV).  Limiting voltages are listed on the appropriate
Curve and Data table in reference (a).

at the EPCP) immediately prior to securing the test discharge.



                                           

                   

(8) Actual capacity - enter the actual capacity in percent.  Capacity is always
logged to the nearest tenth (i.e., 100.5%).  Capacity is computed as:

Percent capacity =  Actual time (min) x 100
Rated time (min)
(9) Ten lowest voltage cells at end of discharge - list ten individual cells with the

lowest end of discharge voltage.  Cells should be listed in ascending (lowest to
highest) voltage order for trending purposes.

NOTE: LIST PILOT CELLS IN AN ASCENDING ORDER, WITH THE LOWEST

Numbered pilot cell listed first.
Note: Data should be entered into the battery record book as

Soon as possible upon completion of the charge or
discharge in order to prevent the loss of data should the
battery charge or discharge log be lost during the
review process.  This initial data entry may be done in
pencil to prevent unnecessary line outs until the charge
review process is complete.

(1) Pilot Cell Numbers - enter, in the space provided at the top of each page, the
current pilot cell numbers.  If the pilot cell(s) are changed, draw a single line
through the old pilot cell number(s) and write in the new pilot cell number(s).
The change need only be made on the page in which the pilot cell(s) are
Changed.

(2) Date - enter the date entered on the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA
9320/6).  This should reflect the date in which the charge was begun.

(3) Type of charge - enter the code that reflects the type of charge conducted.
These codes apply:

N =  Normal charge
E =  Equalizing charge
P =  Partial charge
EE =  Extended or non-tapering charge
(4) Charge number - enter the charge numbers in sequential order.  Charge

numbering begins with the first on board charge.
(5) SG and temperature-pilot cells - the data to be entered in this section should

match the data entered in the “Specific Gravity Data” block in the lower right
hand corner of the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6).  As noted at the
top of each page of this section, all SG entries must be the temperature
Corrected values (height corrections are not used for the current batteries).

corrections can be accomplished by using the TCV formula.  Enter a
value of “1” for the “N” (number of cells) value.

(b) Total voltage corrected to 80°F - enter the TCV value.  TCV is
calculated using the formula in reference (a).  (The last on charge
battery voltage reading entered on the Submarine Battery Log
(NAVSEA 9320/6) must be used in this calculation).  This value need
only be entered for equalizing and non-tapering equalizing charges.
This value is contained in Block 4 of the Submarine Battery Log
(NAVSEA 9320/6).

(7) Minutes on charge after reaching TVG at finishing rate - enter the total time (in
whole minutes) from the point at which the finishing rate is reached at TVG
until the charge is completed.  This value need only be entered for equalizing
and non-tapering equalizing charges.  This data is contained in Block 5 of the
Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6).

(8) Hours of charge to nearest tenth (this charge) - enter the total number of hours
(to the nearest tenth) to complete the charge (time from the first on charge log
readings, until the last on charge log reading).  This data is contained in Block
6 of the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6).

(9) Amp-hours of charge per battery (this charge) - enter the calculated ampere
hours of charge.  (Calculate as indicated in reference (a)).  This number should

Percent charge back = Ampere hour meter charged x 100
Ampere hour meter discharged
(13) Ampere hours by meter - enter the values as read directly from the ampere

hour meter.  Discharged values are the ampere hours as read immediately prior
to the start of charge.  Charged values are the ampere hours from the beginning
(following resetting (zeroing) the ampere hour meter) of the charge to the
charge completion.  The mode selector switch must be placed in the
appropriate position (depending on ampere hour meter type used).  The values
for discharge and charge ampere hours are contained in Blocks 10 and 11
respectively of the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6).

(14) Totals - both monthly and grand totals must be calculated at the end of the
calendar month.  Quarterly totals need not be maintained, but may be
calculated if desired.  If quarterly totals are maintained, entries should coincide
with the submission date of the QBR.  The following values must be computed
for monthly and grand totals (and quarterly, if maintained).

(a) Hours of charge to nearest tenth (this charge) - computed by adding the
hours of charge values for each individual charge.

(b) Ampere hours of charge per battery (this charge) - computed by adding
the ampere hours of charge values per battery for each individual
charge.

(c) Total cycles for charge to nearest 0.1 - computed by dividing the
appropriate (monthly, grand totals or quarterly) ampere hours of charge
by the appropriate service cycle as listed here:

discharge or charge for each individual charge.

Note: Only monthly totals are required for ampere hours by
meter.  Grand Totals need not be maintained.

(15) BRB audits and records reviews - between 9 and 15 months since last
inspection, through a NAVSEA contract, a battery manufacturer’s
representative will conduct an on-site battery inspection.  The BRB will be
signed and dated following the representative’s review.  Where possible, the
dated signature will be placed after the last month of the inspection period in
the “Condensed Summary of All Charges and Waterings” section.  Battery
records should be made available for overnight off-ship review by the battery
manufacturer’s representative.
