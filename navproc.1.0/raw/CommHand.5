6.2.3 Department of Defense Requirements for Reporting Contact with the International
Committee of the Red Cross

The Secretary of Defense, in his memorandum of 5 October 2007 with the subject line: “Amended Policy
Guidance on International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Communications,” requires DoD personnel to
report contacts with the ICRC.

1. All ICRC reports, written or oral, received by a military or civilian official of the DoD at any level shall,
within 48 hours, be transmitted via e-mail through the operational chain of command to designated
representatives within the cognizant combatant command. The combatant command shall then transmit
such reports within one day of receipt to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)) with
information copies to the Director, Joint Staff; the DoD General Counsel; and the DoD Executive
Secretary. ICRC reports received within a combatant command area of operation shall be transmitted
simultaneously to the commander of the combatant command.



                                       

            

2. Oral ICRC reports shall be summarized in writing, and shall contain the following information:

a. Dates and location of the ICRC communication

b. Subject matter of the communication

c. Name of the ICRC and DoD representatives

d. Actions taken or planned by the command in response to the ICRC communication.

3. The senior commander or DoD official to which an ICRC communication is addressed shall provide a
timely written response to the ICRC acknowledging the communication and, to the extent practicable,
provide a written response to the ICRC addressing substantive matters raised by the ICRC, including
answering requests for information, and explaining actions taken to resolve alleged deficiencies identified
by the ICRC communication. This written response will be forwarded to DoD in the same manner
(detailed above) as the original ICRC communication.

4. All ICRC communications shall be marked with the following statement: “ICRC communications are
provided to DoD as confidential restricted-use documents.” ICRC communications will be safeguarded in
the same manner as SECRET NODIS information using classified information channels. Dissemination of
ICRC communications outside of DoD is not authorized without the approval of the Secretary or Deputy
Secretary of Defense.
