4.3.2  Periodicity of Inspections.  Diesel engines must be inspected per references (a) and (b) on
the following events:
a. Routine and Pre-Availability Inspections.
(1) Once during the unit’s cycle, not to exceed 24 months.  The normal interval

between routine diesel inspections is 18 months.  Routine and Pre-Availability
Inspections may be performed as early as 12 months or as late as 24 months to
allow for maximum scheduling flexibility and utilization of assessment
findings.  The TYCOM, Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) and other
Fleet Maintenance Managers must ensure the Routine and Pre-Availability
Inspection is scheduled to allow adequate time prior to availabilities to utilize
the inspection and assessment results to plan work on the diesel.  As per
reference (a), in no case must the interval between Routine Inspections exceed
24 months.  A Routine or Pre-Availability Inspection normally consists of all
three phases as discussed in paragraph 4.3.4 of this chapter.  For Emergency
Diesel Generators (EDG) onboard nuclear powered vessels, industrial activity
work on the diesel engine(s) or its support systems will not normally be
approved except during a Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Availability.  The
TYCOM or ISIC must ensure that adequate upkeep time is made available
prior to the availability to ensure there are a sufficient number of diesel engines
with no outstanding discrepancies to provide the required standby power
during the availability.

(2) For Submarine CNO Availabilities greater than six months.
(a) The Pre-Availability Inspection must be integrated into the Shipyard’s

work definition period and must be considered the material health
assessment for the EDG.

(b) SUBMEPP must enter this Pre-Availability Inspection in the applicable
000-Series SWLIN as a material health assessment assigned to Forces
Afloat.

(c) The DEI must include the Executing Shipyard (Code 260) and the
Supervisor of Shipbuilding or NAVSEA Shipyard Representative’s



                               
           

      

Office, as applicable, on distribution for all DEI reports conducted as a
Pre-Availability Inspection or during the availability.

(d) As Lead Maintenance Activity, the executing shipyard will work with
the TYCOM to assign all deferred inspection deficiencies to the
appropriate repair activity for repair.

(e) The Shipyard’s technical review of this inspection report may satisfy
the Pre-Availability technical assessment requirement of reference (c).

b. Post Casualty or Pre-Overhaul.  When major internal engine malfunctions have
occurred or are suspected (e.g., crankcase explosion, major bearing, blower or
crankshaft failure), or there are indications that the engine is in need for overhaul.
Extent of disassembly or inspection is at the discretion of the DEI based on the
casualty or observed indications.  For Post Casualty Inspections, the DEI must
determine the full extent of damage and the cause, along with recommendations for
repairs.  For Pre-Overhaul Inspections, the TYCOM may require the DEI confirm that
an overhaul is required and determine the scope of the overhaul.  Partial inspections do
not satisfy the requirement for a complete Routine Inspection and this fact will be
annotated in the DEI’s written report.

c. Post Overhaul or Repair.  When an engine has been overhauled or significant
maintenance or repair has been completed.  A Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection
must be conducted by a DEI prior to continuous operation.  The DEI will make the
final determination of whether the overhaul or repair was extensive enough to warrant
a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection.  The inspection must consist of a review of
actions taken to complete the overhaul or repair, external visual inspection, tests of
safety devices, review of required readings or clearances and a Phase III operational
test.  Unless there are indications of internal discrepancies, Phase II (internal
inspection) is waived and the Routine Inspection periodicity requirement in paragraph
4.3.2.a of this chapter will be considered complete and valid.  The Post Overhaul or
Repair inspection should be an integral part of the overhaul or repair vice a separate
inspection.  Specifically, the Phase III operational test should be part of the final
operational testing of the overhaul or repair vice a separate operational test.

(1) For contractor accomplished work, the contractor specification will contain
requirements for the contractor to document required readings or clearances on
applicable forms and have appropriate check points made by a DEI or
Industrial Subject Matter Expert (SME) during the overhaul or repair.  If there
is evidence of poor workmanship, use of improper parts, discrepancies in
reassembly or test documentation or missing information as part of the repair
process or during the inspection, the DEI or Industrial SME will advise the
Repair Project Manager of the quality issues and required actions.  The Repair
Project Manager will coordinate required actions with the RMC Technical
Authority and Maintenance Team.  The RMC must liaise with the TYCOM
and obtain TYCOM concurrence on all required actions and must advise the
TYCOM of all potential cost and schedule impacts.



                                           

      

(2) For Ship’s Force or Fleet Maintenance Activity accomplished engine
overhauls, a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection will be conducted by a DEI
prior to starting the engine.  The scope of the inspection will be as specified in
paragraph 4.3.2.c of this chapter.  Commanding Officer (or designated
representative) permission is required to perform Phase II (internal inspection)
when requested by the DEI.

d. New Construction (Acceptance Inspection).
(1) Prior to the delivery of a newly constructed ship, when requested by the Board

of Inspection and Survey.  An acceptance inspection will normally be
conducted in conjunction with the open-and-inspect phase of Board of
Inspection Survey acceptance trials.  The acceptance inspection does not
satisfy the requirements of a routine inspection.

(2) The initial Routine Inspection on a new construction unit must occur prior to
initial startup by Ship’s Force.  The cognizant Supervisor of Shipbuilding
should incorporate the DEI as part of the Government Test Plan or Acceptance
Plan.  The cognizant Supervisor of Shipbuilding must notify the DEI for new
construction acceptance test prior to Ship’s Force accepting responsibility of
the diesel engine.  This will ensure that an inspection baseline is established
and construction discrepancies are identified and corrected early in the life of
the unit.

(3) For submarine and CVN construction programs, the initial Routine Inspection
on a new construction unit must occur prior to initial startup by Ship’s Force.
For ships with temporary systems in place or less than 95 percent load
available, the Phase I (see paragraph 4.3.4a of this chapter) and Phase II (see
paragraph 4.3.4b of this chapter) inspections must occur in conjunction with
crew Operational Control Transfer including an operational test at available
load.  The Phase III (see paragraph 4.3.4c of this chapter) inspection must
occur prior to ship delivery when sufficient loading is available.  Any as found
conditions requiring corrections must be adjudicated via the normal shipyard
Operational Control Transfer inspections adjudication process.  The routine
diesel inspection periodicity must commence upon completion of all three
diesel engine inspection phases.

e. Reactivation of Engines in Inactive Equipment Maintenance.  Prior to the first
operation of engines which have been placed in Inactive Equipment Maintenance.
The inspection consists of a complete review of the administrative records associated
with the diesel engine including:  actions taken to place the engine in and out of lay-up
status, a review of repairs accomplished since the last inspection, visual inspection,
test of safety devices and an engine performance test.  If sufficient load cannot be
attained, a 1-hour operational test at maximum available load must be accomplished.
Based on the administrative review and visual inspection, further internal inspections
may be accomplished at the discretion of the DEI.  This inspection should be
requested far enough in advance of the first key event requiring use of the diesel.  This
will ensure any significant discrepancies found can be corrected prior to the start of
the key event.  This inspection does not satisfy the requirements of a routine



                               
           

      

inspection as per paragraph 4.3.2.a of this chapter unless a complete 3-phase
inspection is accomplished.  If a complete 3-phase inspection is not accomplished and
administrative, visual and operational inspections are satisfactory, the reactivation
inspection report letter or cover letter should provide revised dates for the next
required inspection that account for the time in Inactive Equipment Maintenance
status.  The revised date for the next routine inspection must be equal to the
completion date of the previous routine diesel inspection plus the number of whole
months the engine was in Inactive Equipment Maintenance status plus 12, 18 and 24
months respectively for the earliest, normal interval and latest dates.
