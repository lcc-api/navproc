2.6.14 Prepublication Reviews

The editorial production contractor will incorporate the Review-approved changes into the master copy of the
publication(s). Production of NATOPS publications requires close coordination between the NATOPS Model
Manager, the NATOPS Products Administrator (AIR-4.0P Airworthiness Directorate), NATEC, and the editorial
production organization. Information in the Review report may be incomplete or difficult for the editor to interpret.
If questions arise, delays will occur until the editor receives the information necessary to proceed. When questions
do arise, every effort should be made to forward the necessary information to the editors as expeditiously as possible
to avoid further delays.

During incorporation of the approved items into the manual, there should be at least one in-process review scheduled
for the NATOPS Model Manager or his designated representative(s) to ensure that the technical information is being
incorporated into the publication(s) as intended by the Review. The new table of contents and index, which are not
generated until after the contents of the chapter pages are fixed, will not be available during the in-process reviews.
In-process reviews are normally done via email or at the editorâ€™s production site. All discrepancies requiring
correction should be listed and passed to the contractor. Unrecorded discrepancies are often overlooked and may not
be corrected.

After the chapters have been reviewed and the complete publication has been assembled, including table of contents
and index, AIR 4.0P shall perform a final review of the completed publication(s) prior to printing and distribution.
Travel and TAD funding for the NATOPS Model Manager or his representatives to attend the final review is the
responsibility of the MMU.

In-process and final reviews shall be completed in an expeditious manner as coordinated by 4.0P and the editorial
team. Delays in production initiated by the NATOPS Model Manager to resolve unexpected problems discovered with



             

             

the approved items are unacceptable. Model Managers shall recommend modifications to the approved text via the
interim change process rather than interrupting editorial production of the publication(s), unless waived by the
NATOPS Products Administrator (AIR-4.0P Airworthiness Directorate).
