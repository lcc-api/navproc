12.2 Improper use of protective signs, signals, and symbols

Improperly using protective signs, signals, and symbols (see paragraphs 8.5.1 and 8.5.2) to injure, kill, or capture
the enemy is an act of perfidy. Additionally, use of protective signs, signals, and symbols to impede enemy
military operations or to protect oneâ€™s own military operations is also prohibited. Such acts are prohibited because
they undermine the effectiveness of protective signs, signals, and symbols and thereby jeopardize the safety of
noncombatants and the immunity of protected structures and activities. For example, using an ambulance or
medical aircraft marked with the Red Cross or Red Crescent to carry armed combatants, weapons, or ammunition
with which to attack or elude enemy forces is prohibited. Similarly, use of the white flag to gain a military
advantage over the enemy is unlawful.
