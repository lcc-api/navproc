4.6.3  Continuous Maintenance Availability Completion Procedures.  The following procedures
will be utilized for completing a CMAV.  Exceptions are provided for those CMAVs of less than
four weeks, or are of a minor scope where the PB4M may be an appropriate forum.
4.6.3.1  Management Reports Closeout Procedures.  Upon completion of a scheduled
availability, the MDS files must be updated to reflect the current status of work.  To accomplish



                               
           

         

This goal and to ensure that all activities understand the status of all work, the following
procedures will be followed:
a. Upon completion of the assigned work, the LMA or Executing Activity will present a

copy of the work candidate or a list of completed JCNs with the applicable final action
codes to the ship to obtain concurrence that the described work was completed.  Ship’s
Force will complete all AWRs per reference (c).  Within 2 weeks of completion, the
Executing Activities who have performed any configuration change must submit the
form 4790 CK of reference (c) to Ship’s Force for submission to Configuration Data
Managers Database - Open Architecture.

b. Within two working days after the completion of an availability, all work centers will
ensure that final man-hours have been entered.  The ship’s superintendent may sign
off all Executing Activity routines for the ship.  Completed work candidates and
AWRs will be a product of the CMAV Departure and Assessment Conference of
paragraph 4.6.3.2 of this chapter.

c. On the third working day after the completion of an availability, the Maintenance
Team will ensure that the CSMP ship and shore files reflects the current status of the
ship’s JCNs and request a Departure and Assessment Report by priority for the ship.

d. On the fourth working day after the completion of an availability, the ship’s
superintendent will annotate each incomplete JCN on the final Departure and
Assessment Report by JCN as to its present status and actions required in order to
complete the item.  Lead work centers must update this status into the MDS.

e. Within seven working days after the completion of an availability, the Executing
Activity will forward copies of the annotated Departure and Assessment Report to the
ship and ISIC.

f. Review status of outstanding DFSs.
4.6.3.2  End of Scheduled Continuous Maintenance Availability Departure and Assessment
Conference.  This comprehensive review and critique of the availability is another cornerstone of
the continuous improvement policy regarding Fleet maintenance.
a. Purpose.  The CMAV Departure and Assessment Conference is held to:
(1) Review the conduct of the availability and identify those improvements

necessary to increase the effectiveness of Fleet maintenance.
(2) Identify the work that was completed during this CMAV and complete the

appropriate documents (e.g., work candidates, AWRs, etc.) or produce the list
necessary to update the ship’s CSMP to reflect the completed work.

(3) Identify and reschedule to a future CMAV, the work deferred during this
CMAV.

(4) Identify any incomplete work candidates and plan of action to complete items.
(5) Establish the basic requirements (i.e., initial work package, sequence number

and tentative dates) for the next CMAV.
(6) Review status of outstanding DFSs.



                                           

         

b. Execution.  The Departure and Assessment Conference will be held during the last
week of the CMAV at a time agreed upon by the Executing Activity Repair Officer or
Production Officer and the ship.  This meeting may be held in conjunction with the
final weekly Management Conference or Progress Review.

c. Attendees.  The Departure and Assessment Conference is arranged, coordinated and
chaired by the LMA Repair or Production Officer.  Where the LMA is a contractor,
the LMA Project Manager may co-chair these meetings with the NSA Project
Manager.  However, lack of participation by the contractor does not alleviate the NSA
Project Manager of this responsibility.  The following personnel must attend this
meeting and participate in its agenda:

(1) ISIC Supply Materials, Weapons, Combat Systems, Electronics Material
Officer, and Submarine Engineering Management, Monitoring and Fleet
Maintenance Support Program Office or PMT Staff personnel (as applicable).

(2) LMA Repair Officer, Production Officer, and Ship Superintendent, or their
designated representatives.

(3) Tended ship CO, MST OIC (if applicable), Engineer and Availability
Coordinator.

(4) Others as directed by the TYCOM, ISIC or Executing Activity CO.
(5) Executing Activity representatives.
d. Agenda.  The following agenda must be used for reviewing and assessing the CMAV.

Additional items may be added at the discretion of the TYCOM, ISIC, Executing
Activity or ship.  Attendees will be prepared to address their respective portions of the
agenda.

(1) Review of the CMAV work package to establish status of each item and, for
items completed satisfactorily, complete the work candidate or AWR.

(2) Review incomplete work candidates that will remain open from this CMAV
and identify plan of action to complete these items.

(3) Identify and reschedule to a future CMAV the work deferred during this
CMAV.

(4) Assess the scheduling, execution and quality of work accomplished by each
activity during the CMAV.

(5) Assess the quality of general services provided by the Executing Activity site.
(6) Review recommendations for process improvements and possible LEAN

Initiatives.
(7) Assess lost time that prevented or delayed execution of scheduled work.  (Lost

time internal to the Executing Activity, e.g., waiting for transportation, assist
work center, etc. and lost time caused by the ship such as waiting access,
tagout, other Ship’s Force support.)

(8) (Submarines only) At the end of the first normally scheduled CMAV after a
CNO availability, the LMA, via letter, informs the appropriate Naval Shipyard,



                               
           

         

with copies to the TYCOM, PMS392 and SEA04X, of any identified lessons
learned, rework and quality concerns related to Naval Shipyard work.

e. Results.  The LMA must consolidate the minutes of this meeting into the Departure
and Assessment Report to the ISIC and provide a copy to the TYCOM and appropriate
planning activity (and NAVSEA 07 for NAVSEA Submarine Repair Activities only).
The report must include:

(1) List of completed work or completed work candidates or AWRs for direct
input into MDS to update the ship’s CSMP and Configuration Data Managers
Database - Open Architecture.

(2) Preliminary establishment of the next CMAV.
(3) List of policies and processes identified as requiring review for improvement.

Proposed process improvements and corrective actions suggested to improve
the effectiveness of future CMAVs.

(4) Lessons learned from the availability.
4.6.3.3  Fast Cruise or Sea Trials.  The ISIC may schedule a one to two day Fast Cruise as part of
the CMAV Key Event schedule.  This is normally the last major Key Event prior to CMAV
completion.  As a minimum, the Fast Cruise agenda will include specified drills and evolutions
necessary to re-establish proficiency in basic ship operations.  It will also include sufficient
formal testing to certify that the equipment and systems are fully ready to operate at sea in an
operational environment.  For CMAVs less than four weeks, the requirement for a Fast Cruise
must be at the ISIC discretion.  The necessity of Sea Trials is a function of work performed
during a CMAV and may not be required.  If the duration or complexity of the CMAV is
determined to be sufficient to warrant Sea Trials, the Ship, ISIC or TYCOM (as required by
specific Force policy) must determine if a formal Sea Trial Agenda is necessary, and if required,
task the RMC or ship to prepare a formal Sea Trial Agenda for ISIC or TYCOM approval.
