8.4.2  Reactor Plant Systems.  If a nuclear powered ship or nuclear capable FMA is unable to
comply with specifications for reactor plant systems or components listed in enclosure (1) to
reference (g) and also those systems identified as nuclear by the appropriate nuclear or non-
nuclear interface diagram (references (b) and (c)), then a review of NAVSEA 08 requirements
must be requested.  In general, technical resolution to questions or problems for reactor plant
systems or components requires use of a liaison inquiry according to the requirements of
references (b) and (c).
a. References (b) and (c) provide the requirements on submission of LARs for nuclear

Powered surface ships and submarines.
NOTE: LARs SUBMITTED MUST CONTAIN ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY

REFERENCE (b) AND REFERENCE (c) TO ENSURE A RAPID, ACCURATE
RESPONSE.

b. Reference (d) provides the requirements on submissions of LARs for nuclear support
facilities.



                                           

        

c. A LAR should not be submitted for cases of out of specification seat leakage of
nuclear valves after repairs.  The Reactor Plant Planning Yard and Reactor Plant
Prime Contractors do not have the authority to waive valve leakage specifications.
When valve seat leakage exceeds reactor plant manual specification after attempted
Ship’s Force or FMA repairs, the following method may be used to defer rework and
close out the Controlled Work Package (CWP):

Note: This alternative to satisfactory completion of retest is
applicable only to valve seat leakage.

(1) The ship must inform TYCOM (via squadron or group for submarines) by
message with an info copy to NAVSEA 08.  The message must include a
Description of the initial problem, repairs conducted, seat leakage rate, leak
Specification, dates of next availability, status of the following sub-paragraphs
(2) through (5), and request for authorization to continue operation with out-of-
Specification seat leakage.

(2) All hydrostatic and tightness test requirements must be satisfactorily
completed.

(3) All other portions of the CWP must be properly completed.
(4) A new maintenance deferred action must be submitted to the ISIC for repair of

the valve seat leakage at the next FMA availability.
(5) The valve seat leakage must not constitute an operational problem (for

submarines, Group or Squadron’s determination and justification statement
required).

(6) Based on Ship’s justification statement, TYCOM will respond by message to
all concerned regarding deferral of corrective maintenance.  After satisfactory
final review, closeout of the CWP can be made with an approved deferral of
Corrective maintenance in lieu of a satisfactory seat leakage test.

d. A liaison action file, with a sequential index and containing all submitted Nuclear
LARs, must be maintained by the originating activity.  The file must contain a copy of
LARs submitted.  A copy of the liaison action must be kept with liaison requests in the
Answered LARs section and in the CWP or Formal Work Package if applicable.

e. Request for DFS for nuclear systems will be neither requested nor approved.  If a ship,
FMA or shipyard has a question, problem or is unable to comply with nuclear
specifications, request for technical resolution will be made using an LAR or Trouble
Record.
