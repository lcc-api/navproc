1.2.8  Direct Cost Basic Definition.  Reference (a) defines a production operation as a direct cost
center.  Direct costs, whether funded with direct mission funds or customer reimbursable funds, are
defined as those items that can be identified to a specific ship’s hull, ship class, end product or a
customer order.  Reference (a) also identifies direct costs as including labor of identifiable
individual employees, material required for the job, travel and contracts or services required to
complete the end product.  Costs may be charged direct when the following criteria are met:
a. Readily identifiable with the benefiting ship’s hull, ship class, end product or customer

Order.
b. The effort expended is conducive to uniform costing to a specific ship’s hull, ship class,

End product or a customer order.
c. Readily definable and appraisable for planning, estimating and authorization of effort to

be expended to a specific ship’s hull, ship class, end product or a customer order.
d. An individual employee’s hours must be identifiable and measurable to a specific job.

The FMA may not prorate labor hours at the end of a shift between direct and overhead
or between direct Job Order Numbers.  Cost proration within direct is permitted when
absolutely necessary to accurately charge costs to the benefiting customers.  Proration
should be a rare occurrence.

e. Direct labor may include:
(1) Craft and trade skill labor, production support such as crane operators and

material handlers, planners and schedulers, project management team
members, waterfront maintenance teams and class teams (including clerical
support), Engineering Services (including Chief Test Engineers, Assistant
Chief Test Engineers, Shift Test Engineers, Shift Refueling Engineers, and
Chief Refueling Engineers), Technical Support which includes inspections,
certifications, assessments, distance support and on-site technical assistance.

(2) Direct labor may also include project-related contract and fund administration,
including but not limited to:  contract managers, contracting officer’s
representatives, price and cost analysts, cost monitors, and quality assurance
specialists.

f. Where direct charging is indicated but the cost of the effort (including clerical) required
for such charging makes it impractical or burdensome (cost versus benefit) and the
direct charge is not material to the total cost of the project, the effort should be charged
to overhead.
