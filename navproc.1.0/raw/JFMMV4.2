10.5  FINAL CERTIFICATION, CLOSEOUT AND RE-ENTRY OF SUBMARINE SPACES,
TANKS AND VOIDS.
10.5.1  Purpose.  To establish procedures for the final certification, closeout and re-entry of
submarine spaces, tanks and voids.
10.5.2  Discussion.  Historically during space, tank or void closeout, a large number of diverse
and inconspicuous items have been overlooked.  These items have, at times, seriously degraded
both material readiness and acoustic signature of submarines.  This section establishes a
procedure to ensure a thorough certification of all spaces prior to final closeout and provides a
check-off list when re-entry is required.  The check-off list or sheet is not all-inclusive.  Common
sense and effective use of personnel experience and knowledge must be used to ensure complete
and thorough inspections.  A review of references (g), (h) and (i) should be performed to
determine if a formal report of unscheduled visual inspection is required to be submitted for tank



                               
           

        

and voids being entered or closed.  Non-steel damping and acoustic restraining covers are not
required to be painted.  Accidental overspray is acceptable.  Full paint out of damping restraining
covers and acoustic tile covers is not the intent.  If damping and acoustic tiles are painted, they
must be checked to ensure that the paint will not bridge the gap between the rubber and the
restraining cover more than 75% over an area.  Degradation of the performance of tiles is
possible.  A suggested way to repair the area is to score the gap between the restraining cover
and the damping tile and between the acoustic tile covers and the rubber.  Previously painted
serviceable tiles may remain in service.  Reference (g) allows paint on piping.
NOTE APPENDIX G MAY BE USED AS AN AID FOR ENTERING SUBMARINE

SPACES, TANKS AND VOIDS.
10.5.3  Action.
a. The Damage Control Assistant (DCA) is designated the coordinator for the closeout of

all spaces.  As such, he is responsible for the following:
(1) Assigning responsible personnel to closeout or assist in closing out specific

Spaces, tanks and voids.
(2) Providing personnel designated to conduct tank, void, or space closeouts with a

copy of Appendices G or H as applicable.
(3) Ensuring personnel performing closeouts are aware of their responsibilities and

are adequately trained.  He must provide, by periodic notice, a list of personnel
qualified to perform closeout inspections.

(4) Maintaining a folder for completed copies of Appendix H.  This folder will
serve as a space, tank and void closeout certification record.  Only the most
recent copies of these Appendices are required to be retained.  This folder
should also include an index of all spaces, tanks and voids applicable to
closeout certification and their status.

(5) Keeping the Commanding Officer and the Engineer Officer informed as to the
status of closeouts and significant deficiencies noted.

b. Personnel performing tank, void and space closeout or entry are responsible for:
(1) Obtaining a copy of Appendix G and Appendix H.
(2) Forwarding to the DCA completed copies of Appendix H.
NOTE A REVIEW OF REFERENCES (G), (H) AND (I) SHOULD BE PERFORMED

To determine if a formal report of unscheduled visual
inspection is required to be submitted for tanks and voids
being entered or closed.

c. Responsibility for Re-Entry Controls (REC) and final certification are:
(1) In cases where entry is required to be made for production work by both Ship’s

Force and FMA personnel, the FMA will be responsible for REC and Ship’s
Force will be responsible for final certification closeout.

(2) For cases where only FMA work is anticipated, the FMA will be responsible
for REC and Ship’s Force will be responsible for final certification closeout.



                                           

        

For the cases in which only the maintenance activity has access (e.g.,
waterborne entry into mud tanks or ballast tanks by divers) the maintenance
activity will be responsible for final certification closeout.

(3) For cases where only Ship’s Force work is anticipated, Ship’s Force will be
responsible for REC and final certification closeout.

10.5.4  Applicability.  All SSN, SSBN and SSGN Class submarines and FMAs.
