7.3.1 Neutral Lands

Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or war materials and supplies across neutral land territory. Neutral
States may be required to mobilize sufficient armed forces to ensure fulfillment of their responsibility to prevent
belligerent forces from crossing neutral borders. Neutral States have discretion whether to allow belligerent forces
seeking refuge to enter their territory. However, belligerent troops that do enter neutral territory must be disarmed
and interned until the end of the armed conflict.

A neutral may authorize passage through its territory of wounded and sick belonging to the armed forces of either
side on condition that the vehicles transporting them carry neither personnel nor material of war. If passage of sick
and wounded is permitted, the neutral State assumes responsibility for providing for their safety and control. POWs
who have escaped to neutral territory are deemed to have successfully escaped from the Detaining Power. A neutral
State may deny the admission of escaped POWs or receive them. A neutral State that receives escaped POWs shall
leave them at liberty. If it allows them to remain in its territory, it may assign them a place of residence.
