8.6.3.1 Hospital Ships, Medical Transports, and Medical Aircraft

Properly designated and marked hospital ships, medical transports, and medical aircraft, as well as coastal rescue
craft are exempt from destruction or capture. A hospital ship’s medical personnel and crew must not be attacked
or captured even if there are no sick or wounded on board. Names and descriptions of hospital ships must be
provided to the parties to the conflict not later than 10 days before they are first employed. Thereafter, hospital
ships must be used exclusively to assist, treat, and transport the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. All exterior
surfaces of hospital ships are painted white and the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross or Red Crescent is
displayed on the hull and on horizontal surfaces.

In the actual employment of hospital ships, the application of some previously well-established principles has
adapted to reflect the realities of modern circumstances. Traditionally, hospital ships could not be armed, although
crew members could carry light individual weapons for the maintenance of order, for their own defense and that
of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. However, due to the current threat environment in which the red cross
symbol is not recognized by various hostile groups and actors as indicating protected status, the United States
views the manning of hospital ships with defensive weapons systems, such as antimissile defense systems or
crew-served weapons to defend against small boat threats as prudent AT/FP measures, analogous to arming crew
members with small arms, and consistent with the humanitarian purpose of hospital ships and duty to safeguard
the wounded and sick. Additionally, weapons and ammunition taken from the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked,
may also be retained on board for eventual turn-over to proper authority.



                                       

             

Further, Article 34, Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and
Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949, provides that hospital ships may not use or
possess “secret codes” as means of communication so that belligerents could verify that hospital ships’
communications systems were being used only in support of their humanitarian function and not as a means of
communicating information that would be harmful to the enemy. However, subsequent technological advances in
encryption and satellite navigation, while recognized as legally problematic, have not been specifically addressed
by treaty. As a practical matter, modern navigational technology requires that the traditional rule prohibiting
“secret codes” be understood to not include modern communications encryption systems. However, such systems
must not be used for military purposes in any way harmful to a potential adversary.

Medical aircraft, whether civilian or military, and whether permanently or temporarily so employed, must be used
exclusively for the removal and transportation of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked, or for the transportation of
medical personnel or medical equipment. They shall not be armed nor configured for reconnaissance. Medical
aircraft shall contain no armament other than small arms and ammunition belonging to the wounded and sick or
necessary for the defense of the wounded and sick and the medical personnel. Medical aircraft must also not be used
to collect or transmit intelligence data since they must not be used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts
harmful to the enemy. This prohibition, however, does not preclude the presence or use on board medical aircraft of
communications equipment and encryption materials solely to facilitate navigation, identification, or communication
in support of medical operations. Medical aircraft should be clearly marked with the emblem of the Red Cross,
Red Crescent, or Red Crystal. Failure to so mark them risks having them not recognized as protected platforms.

Hospital ships, medical transports, and medical aircraft utilized solely for medical purposes and recognized as
such, whether or not marked with the appropriate emblem, are not to be deliberately attacked. Before making
flights bringing medical aircraft within range of the enemy’s surface-to-air weapons systems the enemy should be
notified with a view to ensuring such aircraft will not be attacked. Aeromedical evacuation also may, of course, be
conducted by combat-equipped helicopters and airplanes. They are not, however, exempt from attack, and fly at
their own risk of being attacked.

Hospital ships can leave port even if the port falls into enemy hands. Hospital ships are not classified as warships
with regard to the length of their stay in neutral ports.

Hospital ships must not be used for any other purpose during the conflict, particularly in an attempt to shield
military objectives from attack. To ensure this, an opposing force may visit and search hospital ships, put on
board a commissioner temporarily or put on neutral observers, detain the ship for no more than 7 days (if required
by the gravity of the circumstances), and control the ship’s means of communications. The opposing force may
also order hospital ships to depart, make them take a certain course, or refuse assistance to them.

A warship may demand the surrender of enemy military wounded, sick, and shipwrecked personnel found in
hospital ships and other craft provided they are in a fit state to be moved and that the warship can provide
adequate facilities for necessary medical treatment.

Sick bays and their medical personnel aboard other naval vessels must also be respected by boarding parties and
spared as much as possible. They remain subject to the laws of warfare, but cannot be diverted from their medical
purposes if required for the care of the wounded or sick. If a naval commander can ensure the proper care of the
sick and wounded, and if there is urgent military necessity, sick bays may be used for other purposes.

Medical aircraft must comply with a request to land for inspection. These requests are to be given in accordance
with ICAO standard procedures for interception of civil aircraft. Medical aircraft complying with such a request
to land must be allowed to continue their flight, with all personnel on board belonging to their forces, to neutral
countries, or to countries not a party to the conflict, so long as inspection does not reveal that the aircraft was
engaging in acts harmful to the inspecting force or otherwise violating the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Persons
of the nationality of the inspecting force found on board may be taken off and retained.
