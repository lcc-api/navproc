8.   Categories of Self-Defence. International law and the domestic laws of all nations
recognise a right of self-defence, which is the use of force to defend against attack or
imminent attack. Self-defence is available in all situations, including armed conflict.  National
laws differ on the definition and content of the right of self-defence.  As a consequence,
individuals and units will exercise this right in accordance with their respective national law.
For some nations, self-defence is not governed by ROE.  For some nations, the terms
―hostile act‖ and ―hostile intent‖ are related to mission-accomplishment, rather than self-
defence.  The Handbook has adopted what the drafters view as the more generally
accepted view, while recognizing that nations may have different approaches.  In any event,
the Handbook is intended for use by all nations.  For the purposes of this Handbook, the
right of self-defence is considered on four levels.


a. Individual self-defence. This refers to the right of an individual to defend
himself or herself (and in some cases other individuals) from an attack or imminent
attack.  Some nations permit commanders to limit individual self-defence in the same
way as for unit self-defence (See Annex B, series 10).

b.   Unit self-defence. Unit commanders have the right to defend their unit and
other units from their nation in the face of an attack or imminent attack.  For some
nations, the concept of unit self-defence is both a right and an obligation; whereas for
others the concept is only a right. Some nations permit the right of unit self-defence
to be limited by orders from higher authority. Unit self-defence may be extended to
units and individuals from other nations when authorised by the applicable ROE.
(See Annex B, series 11).

c.   Protection of Others. This refers to the right to defend specified persons (who
are not part of the Force) against an attack or imminent attack.  For some nations,
the right of individual self-defence or unit self-defence may not include the right to
use force to defend another nation’s citizens.  (See Annex B, series 12).

d.   National self-defence.  As recognised in Article 51 of the United Nations
Charter, refers to the right of a nation to defend itself against armed attack, and for
most nations, the threat of imminent armed attack.   (See Annex B, series 13).
Decisions on whether or not national self-defence will be invoked are retained at the
highest levels of governmental or executive authority.
