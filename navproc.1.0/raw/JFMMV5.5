1.2.3  Sustaining Activity or User Activity.  Sustaining and User Activities in some cases may be
the same organization.  The Sustaining Activity is responsible for ensuring that the requirements
established in the Letter of Certification and reference (a) are met.  The Sustaining Activity and
User Activity will:
a. Follow REC procedures during re-entry of a certified component, system or a portion

Of a system.
b. Document all deviations from the certification requirements in a form suitable for

Survey.
c. Accomplish periodic maintenance actions as specified in the supporting requirements

developed for each DSS and ensure that adequate OQE is available during surveys in a
format conducive to review.

d. Ensure accountability of maintenance for each DSS and establish an auditable system
of scheduling, performing and reporting accomplishment of Maintenance Requirement
Cards.

e. Submit an official request to NAVSEA for continuation of certification for a specific
time period and include written rational for the continuation together with a status of
maintenance and system condition.

f. Sustaining Activities will conduct internal surveys per section 4.1.2 of reference (a)
and:

(1) If the SCA sustaining certification survey periodicity is 15 months or greater,
perform at least two internal surveys between the SCA surveys, not to exceed a
12-month periodicity.

(2) Prior to the SCA on-site survey, conduct an internal survey to evaluate
compliance with certification requirements.

(3) For other than overhaul or new construction, complete the Sustaining
Activity's internal survey and submit it to the Program Manager per the
applicable SOC notebook or reference (a) section 4.1.2.

(4) Overhaul and New Construction.  The activityâ€™s internal survey must be
completed not more than 30 days prior to the SCA survey and the results of the
internal survey must be submitted to NAVSEA at least 10 working days prior
to the start of the SCA survey.

(5) Obtain NAVSEA approval of an updated Certification Survey Plan at least two
weeks prior to the SCA survey for an SCA Certification Survey Only.

g. Report to NAVSEA resolution of all survey deficiencies.



                                           

         

h. Retain the completed maintenance and dive log, including, where required, pre-dive
and post-dive check-off procedures for all evolutions from survey to survey.  The
procedures utilized must have prior Program Manager and SCA concurrence.

i. Obtain NAVSEA approval for alterations to items within the SOC.  This includes the
addition of any mission-related equipment outside the defined lines of the DSS as
deemed necessary by the SCA.

j. Accomplish and report Maintenance Requirement Cards and Hull Integrity Procedures
following the assigned periodicities approved by the Program Manager and
immediately resolve any unacceptable conditions found as a result of conducting the
maintenance procedures or inspections.

k. Review and sign the MOA required by Volume II, Part I of this manual.  This
agreement, as a minimum, must define the activity's functions and responsibilities for
implementing and administrating REC procedures.  Volume II, Part I of this manual
contains specific requirements for MOAs.  All applicable activities must sign the
MOA prior to the start of work.

l. The User Activity must issue the DSS certification continuity report before manned
operations (Not applicable when in pursuit of certification or reinstatement of
certification per reference (a) paragraph 3.7.4.).  For vehicles loaded on submarines,
the certification continuity report must be issued prior to the underway of the host ship
(not required to issue DSS certification continuity report for work performed at sea).

m. Obtain formal approval for any temporary modifications prior to installation in a DSS
from the Program Manager.  Submit the request to the Program Manager and include
the items listed in section 5.4.4 of reference (a) and any other items as required by the
Program Manager.

n. Operate the DSS within the limits specified as part of the requirements for each
sustaining certification.

o. The Sustaining Activity must report any violation of the DSS operating limits to
NAVSEA stating the cause or justification for the violation.

p. Keep the Program Manager and SCA advised of any failure or improper operation
experienced by, or damages sustained to, any item or system within the SOC.

q. The responsibilities listed in Part I, Chapter 1 Section 1.5 of this volume apply to the
User or Sustaining Activity.  Each activity must comply with the applicable
responsibilities listed in this section.  For instance, DSSs are responsible for the duties
listed in the Ship Commanding Officer section.

r. When the sustaining Activity is different than the user activity, the Sustaining Activity
will issue a written report to the User Activity, with a copy to parent ISIC, which
addresses the status of SOC RECs, testing of SOC systems, Hull Integrity Procedure
maintenance requirements completed and DFS items.

s. Ensure fact-finding critiques are held to establish underlying causes and pursue
corrective actions when necessary.  When major errors or problems occur during
maintenance of DSS or SOC work, a critique may be necessary.  Examples include



                               
           

         

when significant problems or trends occur or those that did result or could result in
incidents, significant unplanned rework, serious equipment damage, malfunction or
personnel injury.  Minor problems are isolated deficiencies with minimal overall
impact and no significant consequences; these should normally be corrected on the
spot and without expending much time and effort.  Contact the ISIC immediately of
issues which will result in a SUBSAFE, FBW SCS, DSS or SOC critique, SUBSAFE,
FBW SCS, DSS or SOC trouble report or SUBSAFE, FBW SCS, DSS or SOC fact-
finding  (Submarines only) Additional guidance and direction for critiques is
contained in reference (b).  Copies of critiques and incident reports for DSS or SOC
issues that result in a problem severity level of Level 1 (critical) or Level 2 (serious)
will be sent to the TYCOM electronically.

Examples include, but are not limited to the following:
(1) Noncompliant work or technical direction resulting in nonacceptable material

within the DSS or SOC boundary (e.g., incorrect material installed, failure to
complete recertification actions, incorrect torque applied, improper conduct of
testing, wrong weld procedure, lack of or incorrect Nondestructive Test,
unqualified welder, failure to use specified measuring device, etc.).

(2) Inaccurate or missing information or data provided on deliverable DSS or SOC
technical documents affecting the certification status (e.g., certification
messages, Unrestricted Operations Maintenance Requirement Card data
reports).

(3) Conduct of work within the SOC boundary without required authorization or
re-entry control.

(4) Failure to accomplish mandatory SOC related PMS within the required
periodicity.

(5) Performance of DSS manned operations with an open Category 1A, Category
1B (unless as allowed by the card) or expired Category 1C system certification
survey card, or outside of the allowed sustaining certification periodicity.

(6) Operation of SOC systems contrary to or without a NAVSEA approved
procedure.
