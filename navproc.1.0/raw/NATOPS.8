9.3 Aircraft fuel purchase

Because the cost of fuel from non-contract commercial sources is considerably higher than that from military or
contract sources, unit commanders and pilots in command shall make every effort to purchase fuel from military or
government contract sources. Navy and Marine Corps flight personnel are not authorized to purchase aircraft fuel/oil
from other than military or government contract sources except when one of the following apply:

a. Mission requirements dictated stopping at a facility without military or contract fuel sources.

b. The flight terminated as the result of an emergency.

c. The flight terminated at an alternate airport in lieu of filed destination.
