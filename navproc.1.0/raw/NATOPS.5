8.2.1.3 Passengers

Passengers shall comply with the provisions of paragraph 8.2.1.1 n.

a. Passengers in COD aircraft during shipboard launch and recovery and passengers in helicopters/tiltrotors shall
wear an approved protective helmet with reflective tape. The combat/parachutist helmet may be worn in lieu
of the protective helmet with reflective tape, provided hearing protection is worn by all passengers. Waivers of
this requirement may be granted by CMC/COMNAVAIRFOR only.

b. During shipboard logistic, nontactical operations, passengers in aircraft (excluding Fleet Marine Force (FMF)
helicopters, tiltrotors and COD/VOD aircraft) shall wear appropriate anti-exposure protection whenever
antiexposure suits are required for aircrew. Competent authority is authorized to waive this requirement based
on an ORM analysis, which considers rescue distance, expected rescue times, personal health factors, and other
Pertinent aircraft egress factors.

c. For all other aircraft carrying passengers, minimum safety and survival gear shall be as defined by the NATOPS
manual for the specific aircraft.
