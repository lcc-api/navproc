5.4.1 Combatants

Combatants are persons engaged in hostilities during an armed conflict. Combatants may be lawful or unlawful.
Unlawful combatants are more appropriately called “unprivileged belligerents” and are persons who engage in



                                       

            

hostilities without being legally entitled to engage in hostilities. Lawful combatants are privileged to engage in
hostilities during an armed conflict and, hence, are immune from prosecution by the capturing State for their
precapture lawful war-like acts (i.e., combatant immunity). For purposes of combatant immunity, lawful
combatants include members of the regular armed forces of a State party to the conflict; militia, volunteer corps,
and organized resistance movements belonging to a State party to the conflict, which are under responsible
command, wear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry their arms openly, and abide by the laws
of war; and members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not
recognized by the detaining power.

Lawful combatants also include civilians who take part in a levee en masse. A levee en masse is a spontaneous
uprising by the citizens of a nonoccupied territory who take up arms to resist an invading force without having
time to form themselves into regular armed units. Combatant immunity for a levee en masse ends once the
invading forces have occupied the territory.

5.4.1.1 Unprivileged Belligerents

Unprivileged belligerents include civilians who take a direct part in hostilities, and members of armed groups that
fail to meet the criteria for lawful combatant status. Unprivileged belligerents are not entitled to combatant
immunity or POW status. Although an unprivileged belligerent’s act of conducting hostilities is not, per se, a
violation of international law, such war-like acts may be prosecuted as a matter of domestic law.
