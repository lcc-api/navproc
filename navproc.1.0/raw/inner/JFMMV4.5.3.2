24.3.2  Maintenance Policies.  Specific maintenance policies and repair practices are described in
the following paragraphs.
a. As a general policy, because of the ever present risk of decay developing beneath any

wood coating, leave wood strip planked decks uncoated and unpainted.
b. Limit the cleaning of wood decks to scrubbing with mild detergents and salt water.

Never use fresh water for wash-downs since it encourages growth of decay producing
fungi.  Do not use strong detergents, acids, and bleaches for deck cleaning.  Do not
sand decks.

c. Set up a routine of daily wetting down of wood strip planked decks with salt water.
This wetting down causes strip deck planking to remain swollen and creates a tighter
fit between planks.  Wetting down is especially necessary during warm weather
periods when the sunâ€™s heat will quickly dry out the deck planking.  Do not allow
water to accumulate in deck recesses for any length of time.

d. Cover all plywood decks with a coating following the application and deck
preparation procedures of reference (b).

e. Planking renewal will be approved by the TYCOM only on the basis of a technical
survey that has positively shown specific need and complete justification for such
renewal.  Often used general terms such as "Rotten and Worn" are not considered
sufficient justification.  The technical basis for planking renewal must be formed in
the following manner:

(1) Drill test bore holes in weather deck areas to find planking thickness in specific
areas where plank wear is suspected.  If the planking is not worn beyond the
limits set forth in reference (b), the planking will not be renewed unless other
extenuating and justifiable circumstances dictate, and replacement is
authorized by the TYCOM.

(2) Take boring plug samples of planking suspected of being decayed.  Notify the
TYCOM of inspection results.

(3) Once planking has reached the maximum wear limits (found by bore test), the
TYCOM will determine the need to replank or apply a deck coating.

f. So far as practicable, repair deck leaks by recaulking deck seams.



                                           

       

g. When deck planking wear limits have been reached, and other factors such as
extensive deck leaks suggest use of a deck covering, a coating of polyurethane deck
overlay may be used.  Non-skid material must be Naval Sea Systems Command
approved material compatible with the deck overlay as defined in reference (b).

h. Reset metallic planking fasteners when fastener heads are level with, or protrude
above, deck level.  Where the planking level is within 1/4" or less of fastener head,
filling with seam filler vice wooden plugging is authorized.  Where bung plugs are
installed, they must be set in black polyurethane seam filler per the requirements of
reference (c).

i. Ships currently having polysulfide or polyurethane coated strip deck planking in good
condition must continue to use the applied covering.  Make minor repairs to this
polyurethane coating as necessary using either a polysulfide or polyurethane repair kit.
When the polysulfide covering is no longer economically repairable, replace it with a
polyurethane type coating.  Repairing cracks and holes in impervious deck coatings
must be accomplished as soon as practical.  Failure to do so will lead to deck rot and
costly repairs.
