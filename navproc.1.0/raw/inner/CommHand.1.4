2.2.4 Quarantine

Article 0859, U.S. Navy Regulations, 1990, requires that the commanding officer or aircraft commander of a ship
or aircraft comply with quarantine regulations and restrictions. While commanding officers and aircraft
commanders shall not permit inspection of their vessel or aircraft, they shall afford every other assistance to
health officials, U.S. or foreign, and shall give all information required, insofar as permitted by the requirements
of military necessity and security. To avoid restrictions imposed by quarantine regulations, the commanding
officer should request free pratique (clearance granted a ship to proceed into a port after compliance with health or
quarantine regulations) in accordance with the sailing directions for that port.
