5.7.4.1  Contractor vs. Government Furnished Material.  In estimating material costs, no
distinction is made between CFM and GFM.  All material will be priced the same way using
either Government or commercial prices, whichever is most readily available and appropriate.



                                           

        

Generally speaking, because the Government purchases supplies in large lot quantities, the cost
to the Government will be less than it would be to a private contractor making single item or
small lot purchases.  For this reason, Government prices should not be used when estimating
costs for CFM in a work item, however, because the allowable variance in Class F estimates is
40 percent, it is permissible to use either commercial or Government material prices for Class F
material estimates.  This estimate should not include the cost of material to be provided as
Special Program Material or Centrally Procured Material in support of the Navy Modernization
Process (NMP).  Likewise, the cost of repairable items under special turn-around programs
should not be included in the work package.  In developing estimates for work items, a decision
about CFM vs. GFM must be made before the estimate can be finalized.  CFM estimates are
provided on the reverse side of Appendix A.  It is general Department of Defense policy that
contractors provide all material necessary for performance.  That means simply that all material
should be CFM except where it is in the best interest of the Government to provide material as
GFM.  Exceptions to the CFM policy include:
a. Items in long supply in the Navy Supply System (i.e., items stocked far in excess of

expected item demand) should be provided as GFM since it would be wasteful to
require contractors to buy such materials.

b. Items with a set shelf life that will expire before normal draw down in the supply
system should be issued as GFM if such usage remains within the shelf life
requirements.

c. Long Lead Time Material should be provided as GFM.  In Government procurements,
items that are not commercially available within the time period after contract award
and the time the contractor needs the material for production should be considered as
Long Lead Time Material.

d. Standardization material should be provided as GFM.  This material is the Special
Program Material and the Centrally Procured Material purchased in support of the
NMP.

e. Material requiring Provisioning Technical Data should be provided as GFM.
Normally, repair material does not require Provisioning Technical Data because it is
already stocked in the supply system.

f. Material items to be changed out under special turnaround or repairable programs
should be provided as GFM.

g. Material for contractor work performed outside of the U.S.  Overseas contractors may
not have ready access to materials meeting Navy specifications and are often procured
as GFM.
