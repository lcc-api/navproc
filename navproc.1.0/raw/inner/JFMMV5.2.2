5.10.2.2  During Operations.  A DFS is required for any lack of compliance with cognizant
documents or drawings.  For any “as found” conditions or equipment failures that result in a non-
compliance, the ship (or TYCOM if in port) must evaluate the condition or failure using the
guidance of paragraphs 8.2.4 and 8.2.5 of Part I, Chapter 8 of this volume to determine if the
nonconforming condition meets the criteria as a Major or Minor DFS.
a. If the nonconforming condition does not meet the criteria as a Major or Minor DFS,

no DFS is required and the nonconforming condition will be entered in the ship’s
Current Ship’s Maintenance Project (CSMP).  This CSMP entry must include the DFS
serial number, On-Site Analysis Report serial number (if applicable) or other technical
references documenting or tracking the non-conformance.

b. If a DFS is required, the request should be processed as soon as possible to enable an
engineering evaluation of the non-conformance and subsequent approval or
disapproval issued without disrupting ship’s operations.

c. Requests for DFS will be submitted, approved and cleared per paragraph 8.3.7 or 8.3.8
of Part I, Chapter 8 of this volume.  Use of the Web Based Electronic Departure from
Specification and Electronic Waiver and Deviation programs are acceptable unless
directed otherwise by TYCOM.

d. If a DFS is approved as “temporary” and requires rework to correct the discrepant
condition at a later date, a new CSMP entry for correction of the discrepant condition
will be initiated by the ship.  This CSMP entry must include the DFS serial number,
On-Site Analysis Report serial number (if applicable) or other technical references
documenting or tracking the non-conformance.  The ship’s QAO must ensure this
action is accomplished.



                                           

        

e. The QAO must verify that an active Job Control Number (JCN) exists for all active
temporary DFSs at the completion of all scheduled maintenance availabilities or at
least quarterly and must ensure that an auditable record of such verification is
maintained until superseded.

f. For all DFSs, deviations or waivers that have been adjudicated, the approving activity
is required to provide a copy of the DFS, deviation or waiver to the ship’s QAO for
retention and tracking per Part I, Chapter 8, paragraph 8.3.1.e of this volume.
