3.4.2.1.4  Daily Production Meeting.  The RMC Surveyor, Ship’s Maintenance Management
Officer, and other personnel as necessary will meet daily, as a minimum, to review progress with
the intent being to identify possible problem areas that may require specific attention.  The
overall success and effectiveness of any availability is almost entirely a reflection of the
customer ship’s interest in the work being accomplished.
