5.7.1  Preparation.  Estimates for labor required are limited to those direct labor categories
contained in Appendix A.  The form was designed for use in preparing work item estimates for
both competitive and noncompetitive procurements, as well as contract modifications after
award.  In the case of estimating for a work item, the estimate is broken down by paragraph
number in the work items and by Category I Standard Items, where applicable.  In estimating for
work items, the material requirements are designated as Contractor Furnished Material (CFM) or
GFM.  The form is designed to show only CFM requirements in the estimate breakdown by
paragraph.  The GFM requirements are estimated separately.
