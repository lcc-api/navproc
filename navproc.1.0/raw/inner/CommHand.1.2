2.2.2 Warship International Status

As a matter of customary international law, warships enjoy sovereign immunity from interference by the
authorities of States other than the flag State. Police and port authorities may board a warship only with the
permission of the commanding officer. A warship cannot be required to consent to an onboard search or
inspection, nor may it be required to fly the flag of the host State. Although warships are required to comply with
coastal State traffic control, sewage, health, and quarantine restrictions instituted in conformance with the
UNCLOS, a failure of compliance is subject only to diplomatic complaint or to coastal State orders to leave its
territorial sea immediately. Moreover, warships are immune from arrest and seizure, whether in national or
international waters, and are exempt from foreign taxes and regulation and exercise exclusive control over all
passengers and crew with regard to acts performed on board. U.S. Navy policy requires warships to assert the
rights of sovereign immunity.
