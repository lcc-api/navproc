24.3  Deck and hull maintenance.
24.3.1  Inspection Requirements.  With reasonable care, wood-hulled ships can give many years
of economical service.  Make frequent inspections to detect any leaks beneath the covering
board, around the deckhouse areas and seams in the deck planking.  Reference (a) lists general
maintenance requirements for wood-hulled ships.
24.3.2  Maintenance Policies.  Specific maintenance policies and repair practices are described in
the following paragraphs.
a. As a general policy, because of the ever present risk of decay developing beneath any

wood coating, leave wood strip planked decks uncoated and unpainted.
b. Limit the cleaning of wood decks to scrubbing with mild detergents and salt water.

Never use fresh water for wash-downs since it encourages growth of decay producing
fungi.  Do not use strong detergents, acids, and bleaches for deck cleaning.  Do not
sand decks.

c. Set up a routine of daily wetting down of wood strip planked decks with salt water.
This wetting down causes strip deck planking to remain swollen and creates a tighter
fit between planks.  Wetting down is especially necessary during warm weather
periods when the sun’s heat will quickly dry out the deck planking.  Do not allow
water to accumulate in deck recesses for any length of time.

d. Cover all plywood decks with a coating following the application and deck
preparation procedures of reference (b).

e. Planking renewal will be approved by the TYCOM only on the basis of a technical
survey that has positively shown specific need and complete justification for such
renewal.  Often used general terms such as "Rotten and Worn" are not considered
sufficient justification.  The technical basis for planking renewal must be formed in
the following manner:

(1) Drill test bore holes in weather deck areas to find planking thickness in specific
areas where plank wear is suspected.  If the planking is not worn beyond the
limits set forth in reference (b), the planking will not be renewed unless other
extenuating and justifiable circumstances dictate, and replacement is
authorized by the TYCOM.

(2) Take boring plug samples of planking suspected of being decayed.  Notify the
TYCOM of inspection results.

(3) Once planking has reached the maximum wear limits (found by bore test), the
TYCOM will determine the need to replank or apply a deck coating.

f. So far as practicable, repair deck leaks by recaulking deck seams.



                                           

       

g. When deck planking wear limits have been reached, and other factors such as
extensive deck leaks suggest use of a deck covering, a coating of polyurethane deck
overlay may be used.  Non-skid material must be Naval Sea Systems Command
approved material compatible with the deck overlay as defined in reference (b).

h. Reset metallic planking fasteners when fastener heads are level with, or protrude
above, deck level.  Where the planking level is within 1/4" or less of fastener head,
filling with seam filler vice wooden plugging is authorized.  Where bung plugs are
installed, they must be set in black polyurethane seam filler per the requirements of
reference (c).

i. Ships currently having polysulfide or polyurethane coated strip deck planking in good
condition must continue to use the applied covering.  Make minor repairs to this
polyurethane coating as necessary using either a polysulfide or polyurethane repair kit.
When the polysulfide covering is no longer economically repairable, replace it with a
polyurethane type coating.  Repairing cracks and holes in impervious deck coatings
must be accomplished as soon as practical.  Failure to do so will lead to deck rot and
costly repairs.

24.3.3  Deck Covering Repairs.  Interior and exterior deck covering material is prescribed by
Military Specifications and will be installed only as approved by the TYCOM.  Repair
previously installed deck coverings as necessary.  Reference (b) prescribes approved materials
and preparation procedures for wooden decks.
24.3.4  Caulking Techniques.  Removal of old caulking from leaking seams and recaulking is the
standard method for repairing deck leaks.  Fill the caulked seams with a black polyurethane seam
filler, per the requirements of reference (c).  Before filling, caulk the seams with sufficient
cotton.  Seam out gaging (beveling) as specified in reference (d).  Detailed instructions
concerning equipment used, the preparation of seams, the method of application and primers to
be used are described in reference (b).
24.3.5  Weather Deck or Planked Deck Repair.
a. Remove all loose or decayed cotton or oakum caulking after removing all seam filler.

In areas where caulking is found to be in good condition, set this material deeper into
the seam opening, ensuring it is driven in solidly to make room for additional
caulking.

b. Small, tight seams will require a new single thread of cotton.  The size of the seam in
width and depth determines the amount of cotton or oakum required.  Install sufficient
cotton or oakum so that the level of the top of the caulking is 1/4" to 3/8" below the
surface of the decking.  This will allow room for the seam filler.

c. Unless marine glue (pitch) is used as a seam filler, seal the surface of the caulked
cotton or oakum with a special seam primer that is compatible with the seam filler.
Do not use a rubber-type seam filler over oakum.

d. Prime or fill newly caulked seams at the end of each day’s caulking to keep moisture
out of the caulking material and to protect the dry surface of the deck plank seams.

e. Rubber type seam fillers that are installed in seams with a caulking gun must also be
hand worked into the seam with a putty knife.  This is necessary to eliminate air



                               
           

       

pockets and voids in the seam.  Hand working of the seam filler must be in one single
direction to avoid air pockets.

24.3.6  Underwater Planking Repairs.
a. The forward and after rabbet must receive a thorough inspection.  The rabbet seam in

the stern area is covered with an anchor chafe plate and is not available for inspection
or repair unless the anchor chafe plate is removed.  Slack or rotten caulking allows for
infestation of marine burrowers and decay which, in the case of the rabbet seams
forward, goes undetected.

b. Inspect and test caulked plank seams covered with bottom sheathing for soundness
whenever areas are exposed due to the removal of sheathing.  In most cases, the seams
have been covered for many years and have not been available for periodic
maintenance.  These seams, although covered with sheathing, do eventually waste
away or become slack.  The seams at the planking butts are more susceptible to
slackening and erosion due to movement at the joints.  Under normal conditions, it is
necessary to recaulk these joints every 10 to 15 years.

c. If the outer strand of oakum caulking appears to be satisfactory, then the seam may be
repaired by setting the existing caulking deep into the seam and adding more strands
of oakum to fill the seam depth.  If the old caulking is wasted away or decayed, clean
out the seam and remove all caulking and residue to make room for the new material.

d. Before filling the newly caulked seam with a seam compound, paint the oakum and
seam with anti-fouling paint.  Painting the seam protects the oakum from marine
burrowers and primes the wood in the way of the seam filler.  Painting the oakum
produces a hard surface finish which also makes a water barrier necessary for the
protection of the oakum.
