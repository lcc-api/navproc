5.7.3  Quantification of the Labor Estimate.
a. Most work activities are estimated on the basis of the estimator’s judgment and

experience.  Even in the absence of experience, the estimator can still assign



                               
           

        

reasonable estimates based on good judgment and knowledge of the work being
estimated.  By mentally going through each step of the work required, the estimator
can assign a labor estimate based on judgment of the time required to accomplish each
step of the work process.  Such detailed estimating can parallel the industrial
engineering methods used to develop estimating standards for repetitive type work.
Industrial engineering standards are the result of comprehensive time and motion
studies of a work process.  The time required to perform each operation is measured
repetitively.  Through analysis, a standard is developed for each step, allowances are
made for distractions and rest periods and a standard allowance is made by summing
the standard for each step plus other applicable allowances.  In mentally paralleling
this process, the estimator is providing the time for each step or motion required.  The
estimates for each step are summed and additional allowances are added for
distractions, rest periods and other possible considerations.  The other considerations
include such items as the following:

(1) Location of Work:  Estimates for a work operation should be greater when the
operation is performed in a congested area.  For example, repairs to a water
fountain in a congested machinery space with other work in progress would be
more time-consuming than the same repairs to a similar water fountain located
on the mess decks, in the absence of other work.  Work operations of any kind
are more time-consuming when performed in conjunction with other work
(mutual interference) or when performed in a cramped or congested area.
Likewise, estimates should be escalated for work performed in a hostile
environment such as in tanks or voids, in poorly ventilated spaces, in hot or
cold spaces, in contaminated atmospheres, etc.

(2) Ship’s Force Work:  When work is being performed on the same equipment or
system by both the contractor work force and the Ship’s Force, there is
normally an added degree of mutual interference to be considered.  Even when
the two work forces are not in the same space, the mutual interference may
lead to inefficiencies that should be considered in estimating the contractor
work.

(3) Prevailing Weather:  When the geographic area for an assigned availability is
known, the geographic weather pattern should be considered.  Likewise, if the
time of year is known, the seasonal weather should be considered.  For
example, it is normally more costly to blast and paint the underwater body of a
ship hull in below freezing weather than in milder weather.  Similarly, the
weather may also impact paint curing times and other time factors considered.

(4) Ship’s Material Condition:  Estimating Standards, historical estimates, “Rules
of Thumb” and other estimating tools available for use are generally applicable
under “average” conditions.  Estimates for many work operations should be
factored to reflect the material condition of the ship.  If the ship is in average
condition, the standards need not be factored.  If the ship is new, then the
standards should be reduced to reflect the better than average material
condition.  If the ship is in very poor material condition, the estimate should be
increased.  Not all work operations are affected by the ship’s general material



                               
           

        

Condition; However, many are, such as surface preparations, painting,
insulation and lagging, structural repairs, etc.

(5) Category I Standard Items:  The NAVSEA Category I SIs are invoked in work
packages following the guidance provided by the Standard Specification for
Ship Repair and Alteration Committee.  When invoked in a job order, the
provisions of the Category I SI apply for the duration of the availability
without further reference.  The estimator must know which Category I SI is
applicable for the work and what the direct, hard-core labor cost impact of
each SI is on the work required.  Each time the provisions of the Category I SI
are applicable in a work item, an allowance should be made to accomplish the
hard-core labor requirements of the SI.  An SI will be invoked if any work in
the areas addressed in the SI is likely in the work package.  Not all Category I
SIs will have a direct hard-core labor cost impact.  Those that do are discussed
briefly in the following sections.

(a) SI 009-04:  Quality System; provide.  Invoked for all significant
availabilities.  This item requires the contractor to develop and use an
inspection system acceptable to the Government.  The contractor must
develop an inspection plan for each item and record inspection results.
This plan must provide for a corrective action program to correct
defective or non-conforming work, maintain a calibration system for
test equipment, control non-conforming material, conduct periodic
quality reviews and provide notification to the Government for each
CHECKPOINT.  When this SI is invoked, nearly every work item
should have approximately 10 percent of the effort allocated to Quality
Assurance and NDT.

(b) SI 009-07:  Fire Prevention and Housekeeping; accomplish.  Invoked
for all manned vessels, unless the Type Commander (TYCOM)
requests SI 009-35.  This item requires the contractor to provide
acetylene or gas supply manifold systems off the ship with shutoff
valves to gas supply on the pier.  This requirement should be
considered in each instance of gas use.  When SI 009-07 is invoked,
approximately 25 percent of the hot work effort should be allocated for
estimating fire watch requirements.

(c) SI 009-10:  Shipboard Asbestos-Containing Material; control.  Invoked
when any machinery, piping and compartment insulation and lagging
may be removed.  Under this item, the contractor is required to provide
a process control procedure for the control of asbestos-based insulation
and lagging materials.  All insulation and lagging materials are
assumed to be asbestos-based until shown to be otherwise.  Work
accomplished must conform to Occupational Safety and Health Act
requirements regarding insulation removals, work zones, protective
equipment and clothing, and disposal of insulation.  Compliance with
these requirements is a labor-intensive operation that must be
considered for each time and place the work is required.  When SI 009-



                               
           

        

10 Is Invoked, approximately 33 percent should be added to the
insulating and lagging estimate of the work item.

(d) SI 009-24:  Isolation, Blanking and Tagging Requirements;
accomplish.  Invoked when equipment, systems, piping or circuits
require isolating, blanking and tagging for safety or cleanliness and to
prevent operation of a system or equipment while work is being
accomplished.  Under the requirements of this item, the contractor is
required to comply with the Ship’s Force system for isolation, blanking
and tagging of equipment or systems in the performance of required
work.  The contractor has to notify Ship’s Force in each instance of
starting or completing work and a contractor representative must sign
the ship’s tag out log.  Further, the contractor has to provide, install and
remove blanks on piping, valves, equipment and components that are
isolated or removed during performance.  Items removed must be
tagged with metal tags.  Electrical cables disconnected must be
insulated and taped.  Each of these requirements requires hard-core
labor for accomplishment and must be considered as part of the work
activity even though not specifically spelled out in the work item (2-
Kilo).  When invoked, approximately 5 percent of the trade hours
should be added to the estimate to cover the requirements of SI 009-24.

(e) SI 009-61:  Shipboard Use of Fluorocarbons; control.  Invoked for all
specifications.  Under this item, the contractor is required to develop
and use a process control procedure to govern control of shipboard use
of fluorocarbons.  The contractor must notify the Government in each
instance of use of fluorocarbons and must provide ventilation and
telephonic communications for transfer operations, suspend hot work in
spaces affected by atmospheric fluorocarbons, use at least two people
for quantities in excess of 10 pounds and vent gases to ship exterior
atmosphere.  These requirements must be considered in all estimates
involving the use of fluorocarbons.  Approximately 20 percent should
be added to the estimate to cover the requirements of SI 009-61.

(f) SI 009-65:  Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB); control.  Invoked for all
specifications.  Under this item, the contractor is required to develop
and use a process control procedure for control, clean up and disposal
of PCBs.  The contractor must inspect each equipment or component
containing PCBs and make a report.  These requirements must be
considered in any work estimate where PCBs are involved.

(g) SI 009-73:  Shipboard Electrical, Electronic, Fiber Optic Cable;
remove, relocate, repair and install.  Invoked for all specifications
requiring electrical work.  Under this item, the contractor is required to
remove completely all electrical cables no longer necessary due to
work required in the job order.  Work required includes blanking
bulkhead and deck penetrations, removal of unused hangers and
installation of new banding for remaining cables.  Relocation of



                               
           

        

existing cables and installation of new cables requires banding,
installation of hangers, deck and bulkhead penetrations and connection
of cable leads to components or equipment.  These requirements must
be included as work activities in all work on shipboard electrical
cables.

(h) SI 009-106:  Work Authorization and Control Process; accomplish.
Invoked for all specifications.  This requires the contractor to comply
with Volume IV, Chapter 10 of this manual regarding work
authorization.  Specifically, the contractor is required to submit a Work
Authorization Form to the designated representative of the ship’s
Commanding Officer for authorization to start work on each Work Item
in the Job Order.  This is considered an overhead or indirect charge so
no direct labor charges are included in any estimates.

b. References (b), (c) and (d) also can have significant labor impact.  Appendix C is
provided as a check-off list to assist the estimator in properly considering the impact
of Category I Standard Items.  Each of these SIs must be fully understood before an
estimator can properly allow for the cost impact in performance of the work required.
Those items characterized as “labor intensive” must have detailed estimates prepared
to reflect the scope of work required.  The scope of work will vary significantly from
job to job.

5.7.4  Material Estimating.
a. The material estimate usually receives the least attention of all the estimates provided.

This may not significantly affect a small job, but the accumulation of small errors on a
large package can affect the total estimate considerably.  When estimating material
costs, the following must be considered:

(1) The kinds and quantity of each material required to accomplish the work.
(2) Whether the materials are procurable or will be manufactured.
(3) The “lead time” for procuring the material.
(4) Is the material commercially available?
(5) The current or future price for the material.
b. The estimator is not expected to be as familiar with the material pricing as a

purchasing agent, but should be familiar with the market, should know what is scarce
and what is not available from commercial sources and should keep up with current
prices and availability.  The estimator should also use drawing material lists,
equipment technical manuals and Allowance Parts Lists to determine material
requirements.  Cost estimates are then based upon records of previous recent
purchases, current Government and vendor catalogs and consultation with
Government and commercial sources.
