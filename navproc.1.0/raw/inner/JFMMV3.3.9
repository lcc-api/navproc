require no less stringent QA procedures than any other routine planned repair.  While Ship’s



                               
           

       

Force is ultimately responsible for ensuring that appropriate QA is maintained on all repairs,
regardless of who performs the work, the Surveyor overseeing the VRs is responsible to Ship’s
Force to ensure that all requirements specified in the contract are met.  Specific Ship’s Force QA
responsibilities may include:
a. Providing personnel to witness tests and inspections as required by the Surveyor.

Witnesses must be qualified QAIs who are aware of the technical requirements to be
fulfilled by the test or inspection.

b. Ensuring that documentation of each contractor test or inspection is provided to the
QAI at its conclusion.  If not provided, the QAI will use the applicable form from
Volume V, Part I, Chapter 11 of this manual to document the test or inspection.
Records of all Ship’s Force and contractor tests and inspections will be maintained per
Volume V, Part I, Chapter 10 of this manual.

c. Insisting on verbatim compliance with the work specification, through the QAI, during
the test or inspection.  The QAI will immediately inform the appropriate Department
Head and Surveyor of any discrepancies noted.

d. Ensuring that any material provided by Ship’s Force by direction of the work
specification is in strict accordance with technical requirements.

e. Ensuring that no other material, tools, or physical assistance is provided to the
contractor unless it is specifically required by the contract specification or requested
by the Surveyor.  The entire Ship’s Force will be briefed on this prior to the start of the
VR period.

f. Assisting the Surveyor in providing continual in-process inspections of work being
accomplished aboard ship.  In-process inspections of work accomplished off-ship will
be accomplished as deemed necessary by the Department Heads and as agreed to by
the Surveyor.

g. Providing ship-specific operating and design system parameters to aid in determining
actual testing requirements.  Reporting specified test results on appropriate QA forms
to the Surveyor prior to the end of the VR period.

h. Providing all MIC LEVEL I material required to the Surveyor.  Material will not be
accepted unless properly controlled by Ship’s Force.  A face-to-face turnover by a
designated Controlled Material Petty Officer to the Surveyor is required.
