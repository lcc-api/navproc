24.2.2  Recognition.  Decay in the deck and hull structure is often concealed and hard to detect.
It is usually not recognizable by visible fungus except in joints between surfaces.  Decay may be
suspected if paint coating is discolored or the wood surface is cupped.  The affected wood has a
pronounced stringy, fibrous appearance.  Thoroughly decayed wood is brittle which, when dry,
breaks easily across the grain with a distinct brash fracture and may crumble into powder.  Black
stains spreading along the grain from ferrous metal fastenings are usually a result of chemical
reactions instead of from decay fungi.  Testing procedures for suspected decay areas are detailed
in reference (a).
