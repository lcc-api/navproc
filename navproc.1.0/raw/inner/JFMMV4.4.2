22.2  BACKGROUND.  Submarine antenna and Photonics systems associated cable connections
between the antenna and electrical hull fitting are sensitive to seawater intrusion.  In the event
that seawater enters an electrical hull fitting, radome or other powered component and the system
is subsequently powered-on or used for transmission, significant component damage may occur.
