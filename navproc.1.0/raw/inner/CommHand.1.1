2.2.1 Warship Defined

International law defines a warship as a ship belonging to the armed forces of a State bearing the external
markings distinguishing the character and nationality of such ships, under the command of an officer duly
commissioned by the government of that State and whose name appears in the appropriate service list of officers,
and manned by a crew that is under regular armed forces discipline. Warships maintain their status even if
civilians form part of the crew. Ships need not be armed in order to qualify as warships. In the U.S. Navy, those
ships designated “USS” are “warships” as defined by international law. U.S. Coast Guard vessels designated
“USCGC” under the command of a commissioned officer are also “warships” under international law.



                                       

            

During international armed conflict at sea, warships are the only vessels that may exercise belligerent rights,
which include the right to conduct offensive attacks. Other vessels, such as auxiliary vessels and merchant
vessels, are not entitled to conduct attacks in offensive combat operations in an international armed conflict. All
vessels, however, may defend themselves (including resisting attacks by enemy forces). These limitations do not
apply to non-international armed conflicts.
