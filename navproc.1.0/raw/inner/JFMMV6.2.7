9.2.7  Regional Maintenance Center Metrology and Calibration Coordinators.
a. Coordinate and schedule off-ship calibration or repair services for ships within their

geographic area of responsibility.  Specific lack of capability is the only justification
for off-ship calibration.

b. Maintain close liaison with the RMC and RCC shipboard calibration coordinators,
ISIC and TYCOM to prevent or resolve calibration scheduling and readiness
problems.



                                           

      

c. Review ship’s calibration work requests to ensure that TMDE within the calibration
capability of the ship’s FCA are not sent to a higher-level calibration laboratory.

d. Contact all deploying ships that have not delivered a pre-deployment calibration work
package at least 45 days before deployment to determine ship’s requirements.

e. Notify TYCOM METCAL Managers, as applicable, of all changes in RMC or RCC
calibration capability.

f. Assist RMC or RCC calibration laboratories in obtaining calibration or repair services
for laboratory standards.

g. Identify TMDE calibration requirements beyond the technical capability of the RMC
or RCC.  Coordinate with TYCOM METCAL Managers for scheduling of TMDE
overflowed to an approved calibration laboratory.
