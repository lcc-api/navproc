2.10.2  Forward Price Rate Agreement.  A Forward Price Rate Agreement (FPRA) is a written
agreement negotiated between a contractor and the Government to make certain rates available
during a specified period for contractual actions.  Such rates represent reasonable projections of
specific costs that are not easily estimated for, identified with or generated by a specific contract,
contract end item or task.  These projections may include rates for labor, indirect costs, material
obsolescence and usage, spare parts provisioning and material handling.  Negotiation of FPRAs
may be requested by the Contracting Officer, the contractor or initiated by the ACO.  In
determining the need for an FPRA, the ACO should evaluate whether the benefits from the
agreement are worth the effort of establishing and monitoring it.  FPRAs should only be
negotiated with contractors having a significant volume of Government contract proposals.  The
responsible RMC must determine whether to establish an FPRA.  Indirect costs commonly
defined as overhead are defined and described in reference (u) including treatment and
application of indirect costs to contracts.
