5.7.2  Developing the Estimate.  In the estimating process, the estimator describes in broad terms
the sequence of activities required to accomplish the work being estimated.  Typical repair
sequences are shown in Table 5-3.  Next, each of these activities is further broken down to the
lowest level of detail necessary to facilitate the estimating process.  For example, in Sequence B
of Table 5-3, the “inspect” activity may require a detailed inspection of a specific set of internal
components.  Each of the inspections may require a unique set of activities and measurement
criteria.  Thus, each component inspection could be estimated as a separate activity.
a. In quantifying the work required, the estimator should envision what is to be done, as

in a mental time and motion construction of the physical activity required to
accomplish the work.  Inherent in this task is a requirement that the estimator know
the details of the work to be performed.  If the estimator is unsure of the work
activities required, a knowledgeable person should be consulted to determine the



                               
           

        

applicable requirements.  It is essential that the correct processes, technology, tools
and sequence of work activities be considered in developing a detailed estimate.

b. After the mental time and motion analysis is complete, the estimator prepares a
detailed listing of all activities that are to be estimated separately.  The level of detail
should reflect that level needed to support the estimating requirement.  Experienced
estimators do not normally need to break the work down into as many activities as an
inexperienced estimator.  In determining the activities to be considered in the estimate,
it is helpful to use a check-off list of typical requirements in ship repair.  The
estimating check-off list shown in Appendix B is provided as an example and can be
modified as necessary to suit particular situations.  Using the check-off list will
prevent inadvertent omissions of incidental support requirements for the major
activities of work required, (e.g., assist trades, rigging, staging, temporary lighting and
ventilation).

c. In developing the estimate activity list, examine each major activity in the repair
sequence, shown in Table 5-3, to determine whether or not a further breakdown is
needed and to identify the sublevel activities.  Each of the new activities identified
may also require further breakdown until the level of activities is detailed enough to
develop a reasonable estimate.

d. Once all of the activities to be estimated have been identified, the estimator has to
assign labor-hours for each trade and support craft needed to accomplish each activity.
The cost of material to support required work is also estimated for each activity.  The
work item estimate is the sum of all labor-hours and material cost estimates.  Work
item estimates of labor are normally expressed in terms of man-days rather than man-
hours (one man-day being equal to eight man-hours).  Labor estimates for contract
modification are normally expressed in man-hours vice man-days.
