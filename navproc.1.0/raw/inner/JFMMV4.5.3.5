24.3.5  Weather Deck or Planked Deck Repair.
a. Remove all loose or decayed cotton or oakum caulking after removing all seam filler.

In areas where caulking is found to be in good condition, set this material deeper into
the seam opening, ensuring it is driven in solidly to make room for additional
caulking.

b. Small, tight seams will require a new single thread of cotton.  The size of the seam in
width and depth determines the amount of cotton or oakum required.  Install sufficient
cotton or oakum so that the level of the top of the caulking is 1/4" to 3/8" below the
surface of the decking.  This will allow room for the seam filler.

c. Unless marine glue (pitch) is used as a seam filler, seal the surface of the caulked
cotton or oakum with a special seam primer that is compatible with the seam filler.
Do not use a rubber-type seam filler over oakum.

d. Prime or fill newly caulked seams at the end of each dayâ€™s caulking to keep moisture
out of the caulking material and to protect the dry surface of the deck plank seams.

e. Rubber type seam fillers that are installed in seams with a caulking gun must also be
hand worked into the seam with a putty knife.  This is necessary to eliminate air



                               
           

       

pockets and voids in the seam.  Hand working of the seam filler must be in one single
direction to avoid air pockets.
