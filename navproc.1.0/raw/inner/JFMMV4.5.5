24.5  WOODEN HULL BOTTOM SHEATHING.  For bottom sheathing to be effective and to
provide protection to the underlying hull planking, the sheathing must fit the shape of the
vesselâ€™s contoured bottom, be securely fastened, and be faired to the level of adjoining pieces of
sheathing.  The sheathing must be installed per the requirements of reference (a).
a. Sheathing the bottoms of wood vessels serves to protect the hull from burrowers,

especially if the vessels are to endure long periods between dry-dockings.
b. For vessels that are active and are dry-docked annually, the use of sheathing is not

Required.
