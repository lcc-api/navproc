22.3  POLICY.
22.3.1  Hydrostatic Pressure Testing.
a. Hydrostatic pressure testing of submarine antennas with cables attached prior to initial

installation (or after any maintenance actions that requires the disassembly of the
antenna) is mandatory except for buoys and floating wires.  This pre-installation test is
intended solely to verify the correctness of the final assembly and does not equal or
replace the more elaborate acceptance testing required for various individual
manufactured components.  Submarine communications antennas that are required to
be hydrostatic pressure tested are:

Note: All oe-538/592 mast are Hydrostatically tested at either
the oe-538/592 depot or waterfront I-level facility.

(1) Multifunction Masts, OE-538 (SSNs) and OE-592 (SSBNs and SSGNs).
NOTE: ALL SUBHDR MASTS ARE HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED AT THE

Subhdr national maintenance center (NMC) prior to being
issued to the fleet for installation.

(2) Submarine High Data Rate Mast, OE-562 (SubHDR).
b. Buoys that are excluded are:
(1) Submarine Launched One-Way Tactical (SLOT) Buoys (AN/BRT-1 and

An/BRT-1a).
(2) Submarine Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (SEPIRB) Buoy (T-

1630/SRT or T-1630A/SRT).
c. All versions of Floating wires are excluded (i.e. Buoyant Cable Antennas).



                                           

       

Note: The towed buoy antenna, an/Brr-6 (Ssbn 730 - 738) and the
an/Brr-6B (Ssbn 739 - 743) will be hydrostatic tested before
installation according to the maintenance manual.

22.3.2  Fleet Maintenance.  Maintenance actions conducted by Fleet Maintenance Activities or
Ship’s Force regarding the watertight integrity test requirements between submarine antennas
and their respective hull connectors, must be:
a. When the antenna or cable is disconnected or replaced shipboard, the Technical Work

Document will include the following checks in the assembly procedure to reconnect
the cable to the base of the antenna or electrical hull fitting:

(1) Craftsman verification that surface finishes of O-ring seating surfaces are per
applicable specifications.

(2) Craftsman verification that the O-ring is properly installed and per applicable
specifications.

(3) For submarine SubHDR and Photonics systems outboard cable removal and
replacement, accomplish per Volume V, Part I, Chapter 7, Appendix B, NOTE
31 of this manual.

b. Prior to performing a deep dive certification after a maintenance action, passive testing
or pre-energize testing, or both, must be performed following the system specific
Technical Manual, SUBMEPP approved Maintenance Standard, SUBMEPP approved
Standard Test Procedure or Maintenance Requirement Card (MRC) to ensure the
system is not grounded prior to use.

c. Upon completion of a deep dive certification for a maintenance action, passive testing,
pre-energize testing, or both, must be performed following the system specific
Technical Manual, SUBMEPP approved Maintenance Standard, SUBMEPP approved
Standard Test Procedure or MRC to ensure the system is not grounded prior to use.

22.4  Procedure.
a. Upon completion of maintenance and before underway for submerged operations, the

ship must place CAUTION tags on the Main Power Switch or transmit keys for the
affected antennas.  The Amplifying Instructions for the CAUTION tags will state -
“DO NOT OPERATE OR TRANSMIT ON THIS ANTENNA UNTIL
COMPLETION OF PASSIVE CHECKS FOLLOWING A DIVE TO TEST DEPTH.
PASSIVE CHECKS MUST BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH USE UNTIL THE
DEEP DIVE IS COMPLETE.”

b. It is understood that in some cases, due to water depth restrictions, the deep dive may
not be performed for quite some time.  In these cases, the ship should dive to the
maximum depth possible and conduct passive checks.  Provided the checks are
satisfactory, the CAUTION tag may be replaced with one stating - “DO NOT
OPERATE OR TRANSMIT ON THIS ANTENNA FOLLOWING OPERATIONS
GREATER THAN (enter max depth obtained).  PASSIVE CHECKS MUST BE
PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH USE UNTIL THE DEEP DIVE IS
COMPLETED.”



                                           

       

c. The tag(s) may be removed following completion of a deep dive to test depth and
completion of satisfactory passive testing performed following the system specific
technical manuals or Maintenance Index Pages and MRCs to ensure the system is not
grounded.
