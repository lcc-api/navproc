22.3.1  Hydrostatic Pressure Testing.
a. Hydrostatic pressure testing of submarine antennas with cables attached prior to initial

installation (or after any maintenance actions that requires the disassembly of the
antenna) is mandatory except for buoys and floating wires.  This pre-installation test is
intended solely to verify the correctness of the final assembly and does not equal or
replace the more elaborate acceptance testing required for various individual
manufactured components.  Submarine communications antennas that are required to
be hydrostatic pressure tested are:

Note: All oe-538/592 mast are Hydrostatically tested at either
the oe-538/592 depot or waterfront I-level facility.

(1) Multifunction Masts, OE-538 (SSNs) and OE-592 (SSBNs and SSGNs).
NOTE: ALL SUBHDR MASTS ARE HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED AT THE

Subhdr national maintenance center (NMC) prior to being
issued to the fleet for installation.

(2) Submarine High Data Rate Mast, OE-562 (SubHDR).
b. Buoys that are excluded are:
(1) Submarine Launched One-Way Tactical (SLOT) Buoys (AN/BRT-1 and

An/BRT-1a).
(2) Submarine Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (SEPIRB) Buoy (T-

1630/SRT or T-1630A/SRT).
c. All versions of Floating wires are excluded (i.e. Buoyant Cable Antennas).



                                           

       

Note: The towed buoy antenna, an/Brr-6 (Ssbn 730 - 738) and the
an/Brr-6B (Ssbn 739 - 743) will be hydrostatic tested before
installation according to the maintenance manual.
