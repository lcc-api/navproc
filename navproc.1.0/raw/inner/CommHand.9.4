8.11.4 Offensive Cyberspace Operations

Offensive cyberspace operations (OCO) are cyberspace operations intended to project power by the application of
force in or through cyberspace. OCO can be accomplished by lethal and nonlethal means. In employing nonlethal
means of OCO against a military objective, factors involved in weighing anticipated incidental injury/death to
protected persons can include, depending on the target, indirect effects (for example, the anticipated incidental
injury/death that may occur from disrupting an electric generating plant that supplies power to a military
headquarters and to a hospital).

Department of Defense doctrine describes cyberspace as a “global domain within the information environment
consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the
Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”

There are no international agreements that directly address cyberspace in the context of military operations and
state practice is only starting to emerge. Nonetheless, if a cyber operation constitutes a military operation in an
armed conflict, then the laws of armed conflict apply. In particular, if a cyber operation constitutes an armed
attack, then the law of armed conflict and all of its principles apply to that operation.
