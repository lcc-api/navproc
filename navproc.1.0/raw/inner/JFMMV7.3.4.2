5.7.4.2  Sources of Pricing Information.  The most important source of pricing information for
ship repair material is the Navy price list for stocked supplies and repair parts.  This pricing
information, when used in estimating, is adequate for pricing material requirements.  Navy stock
prices should not be used for estimating the cost of CFM in work items because the cost to
industry for the same repair parts and supplies can be considerably higher.  When the use of
Navy pricing information is not appropriate or when the required pricing information is not
available, the best source of current pricing information is the manufacturer or dealer who is in
the business of distributing the materials or parts needed.  Every estimator should maintain a



                               
           

        

listing of vendors, manufacturers, distributors, etc., that can be consulted to obtain current
pricing information.  Where available, catalogs of pricing data should be ordered and maintained
in a central repository for reference by all estimators who may require the pricing information.
Each RMC should maintain a library of current material pricing data for materials frequently
required in typical ship repair activities estimated by the RMC.
