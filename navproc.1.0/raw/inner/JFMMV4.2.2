10.5.2  Discussion.  Historically during space, tank or void closeout, a large number of diverse
and inconspicuous items have been overlooked.  These items have, at times, seriously degraded
both material readiness and acoustic signature of submarines.  This section establishes a
procedure to ensure a thorough certification of all spaces prior to final closeout and provides a
check-off list when re-entry is required.  The check-off list or sheet is not all-inclusive.  Common
sense and effective use of personnel experience and knowledge must be used to ensure complete
and thorough inspections.  A review of references (g), (h) and (i) should be performed to
determine if a formal report of unscheduled visual inspection is required to be submitted for tank



                               
           

        

and voids being entered or closed.  Non-steel damping and acoustic restraining covers are not
required to be painted.  Accidental overspray is acceptable.  Full paint out of damping restraining
covers and acoustic tile covers is not the intent.  If damping and acoustic tiles are painted, they
must be checked to ensure that the paint will not bridge the gap between the rubber and the
restraining cover more than 75% over an area.  Degradation of the performance of tiles is
possible.  A suggested way to repair the area is to score the gap between the restraining cover
and the damping tile and between the acoustic tile covers and the rubber.  Previously painted
serviceable tiles may remain in service.  Reference (g) allows paint on piping.

SPACES, TANKS AND VOIDS.
