9.2.8  Regional Maintenance Center and Regional Calibration Center.
a. Calibrate and repair TMDE including calibration standards assigned by the RMC

METCAL Coordinators.  Document all calibration actions using the METBENCH
Calibration Management System (MCMS), Metrology Automated System for
Uniform Recall and Reporting (MEASURE) or the TYCOM directed data collection
method.

b. Ensure that electronic TMDE submitted by the Fleet is standard test equipment listed
in reference (h).  Contact the submitting activity and the TYCOM METCAL Manager
when non-standard TMDE is submitted for calibration.  Non-standard TMDE will not
be calibrated or repaired unless approved by the TYCOM.

c. Ensure all laboratory standards are properly calibrated at the lowest appropriate level.
Notify the TYCOM METCAL Manager of any lost or reduced laboratory capability.

d. Ensure all TMDE repaired by the RMC or RCC are completely recalibrated before
being returned to service.  Calibration of a repaired instrument will serve as Quality
Assurance of an accomplished repair.

e. Prepare and submit Calibration Problem Reports to NSWC Corona for assistance or
guidance concerning calibration problems encountered during operation of the
calibration laboratory.

f. Refer to Section 9.5 of this chapter for replacing malfunctioning calibration standards
certified by a repair facility to be Beyond Economical Repair (BER), (i.e., having a
repair cost in excess of 50% of the replacement cost).
