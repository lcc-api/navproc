24.3.6  Underwater Planking Repairs.
a. The forward and after rabbet must receive a thorough inspection.  The rabbet seam in

the stern area is covered with an anchor chafe plate and is not available for inspection
or repair unless the anchor chafe plate is removed.  Slack or rotten caulking allows for
infestation of marine burrowers and decay which, in the case of the rabbet seams
forward, goes undetected.

b. Inspect and test caulked plank seams covered with bottom sheathing for soundness
whenever areas are exposed due to the removal of sheathing.  In most cases, the seams
have been covered for many years and have not been available for periodic
maintenance.  These seams, although covered with sheathing, do eventually waste
away or become slack.  The seams at the planking butts are more susceptible to
slackening and erosion due to movement at the joints.  Under normal conditions, it is
necessary to recaulk these joints every 10 to 15 years.

c. If the outer strand of oakum caulking appears to be satisfactory, then the seam may be
repaired by setting the existing caulking deep into the seam and adding more strands
of oakum to fill the seam depth.  If the old caulking is wasted away or decayed, clean
out the seam and remove all caulking and residue to make room for the new material.

d. Before filling the newly caulked seam with a seam compound, paint the oakum and
seam with anti-fouling paint.  Painting the seam protects the oakum from marine
burrowers and primes the wood in the way of the seam filler.  Painting the oakum
produces a hard surface finish which also makes a water barrier necessary for the
protection of the oakum.
