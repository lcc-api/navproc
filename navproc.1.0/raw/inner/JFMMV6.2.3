a. The NAVSEA METCAL TWH is the Technical Authority for all equipment and

systems under the NAVSEA technical cognizance.
b. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Corona Division is the TWH’s Engineering

Agent (EA) for metrology and calibration.  NSWC Corona performs acceptance tests
for new equipment for induction into the METCAL program, sets and modifies
calibration intervals for non-installed TMDE and publishes metrology-associated
documents such as the Naval Calibration Activity List and the Metrology
Requirements List (references (f) and (g)) following SYSCOM directives.  NSWC
Corona may be contacted by telephone or message for resolution of urgent technical
problems related to calibration standards or Instrument Calibration Procedures.

c. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia Division, (NSWCPD) is the TWH’s EA
for all shipboard installed instrumentation.  NSWCPD determines shipboard
instrumentation calibration workload (cal “YES” or “NO”) by applying the principles
of Reliability-Centered Maintenance, sets and modifies calibration intervals for
shipboard instrumentation and systems, develops and validates associated calibration
procedures and publishes related calibration documentation such as ship-specific
Calibration Requirements Lists (CRL), calibration procedures that are issued via the
Planned Maintenance System (PMS) (Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRC)), and
System Calibration Procedures (SCP) following NAVSEA directives (see paragraph
9.7 of this chapter).  NSWCPD may be contacted by telephone or message for
resolution of urgent technical problems related to calibration of shipboard
instrumentation, calibration PMS or SCPs.



                                           

      

d. Naval Air Warfare Center, China Lake is the TWH EA for TMDE, prepares
specifications for new TMDE and makes technical recommendations to the TMDE
