8.11.2 Physical Attack/Destruction

The legal requirement to attack only military objectives and to avoid excessive incidental injury/death and
collateral damage to noncombatants, civilians, and civilian objects applies when identifying targets for physical
attack/destruction as part of an offensive IO plan. Information operations that do not entail the risk of physical
injury or death to protected persons or damage to civilian objects may be targeted at noncombatants and civilians.
