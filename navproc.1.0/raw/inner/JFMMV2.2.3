4.6.3.3  Fast Cruise or Sea Trials.  The ISIC may schedule a one to two day Fast Cruise as part of
the CMAV Key Event schedule.  This is normally the last major Key Event prior to CMAV
completion.  As a minimum, the Fast Cruise agenda will include specified drills and evolutions
necessary to re-establish proficiency in basic ship operations.  It will also include sufficient
formal testing to certify that the equipment and systems are fully ready to operate at sea in an
operational environment.  For CMAVs less than four weeks, the requirement for a Fast Cruise
must be at the ISIC discretion.  The necessity of Sea Trials is a function of work performed
during a CMAV and may not be required.  If the duration or complexity of the CMAV is
determined to be sufficient to warrant Sea Trials, the Ship, ISIC or TYCOM (as required by
specific Force policy) must determine if a formal Sea Trial Agenda is necessary, and if required,
task the RMC or ship to prepare a formal Sea Trial Agenda for ISIC or TYCOM approval.
