or vertical product quality audits are conducted to determine the effectiveness of the contractors
QMS, analysis of the process and assessment of product conformance.  The QMS audit may be
conducted as a single audit or may be a combination of several audits.  Targeted Process and
Product Quality Audits must be scheduled at least once every 12 to 18 months for each
contractor, provided a complete QMS audit is performed every five years.  Attributes for the
accomplishment of the QMS audit must be derived based on contractor performance and do not

product quality audits are encouraged for detailed root cause analysis.  Process and product
quality audits may be prompted by significant changes in the contractorâ€™s QMS, processes or
Product quality.
