8.11.3 Military Information Support Operations

MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their
emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations,
groups, and individuals in a manner favorable to the originatorâ€™s objectives. MISO must not be confused with
psychological impact. U.S. MISO will not target U.S. citizens under any circumstances.
