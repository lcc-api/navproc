3.4.2.1.5  Growth and New Work.
a. Growth work identified during the open and inspect phase of the baseline repairs will

be reviewed for cost and schedule impacts and incorporated in the work package by
the Surveyor, as applicable.  No growth work or new work is authorized to commence
until FLC-NRCD negotiates with the contractor and the appropriate contract
documentation is issued.

b.  New work must be processed and authorized without violating Public Law
restrictions.  To assure these restrictions are not violated, the ship must submit an
OPNAV 4790/2K following the normal process and provide a copy to the Surveyor.
The Surveyor must determine the feasibility of completing new work and must obtain
the required authorization from the Maintenance Manager.
