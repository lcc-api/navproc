3.4.2.1.6  Constructive Changes.  Constructive changes are changes to contracts in the intent of
work specifications directed at the contractor by anyone other than the Surveyor or FLC-NRCD
representative.  Since they are not pre-negotiated with the contractor, constructive changes are
against the law.  Shipâ€™s Force personnel should be cautioned not to direct or otherwise influence
contractor personnel to accomplish work not clearly delineated by contract specifications.
