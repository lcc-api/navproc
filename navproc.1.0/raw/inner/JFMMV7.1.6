2.10.6  Pricing Responsibility.  The Contracting Officer is responsible for exercising proper
judgment and is solely responsible for the final pricing decision.  Although the Contracting
Officer is responsible for the final pricing decision, the Contracting Officer is not expected to
perform all functions leading to the contractual document’s execution.  Although the
recommendations and counsel of contributing specialists, including auditors, are advisory only,
the Contracting Officer should include comments in the price negotiation memorandum when
significant auditor or other specialists’ recommendations are not adopted.
