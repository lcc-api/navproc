5.4.1.1 Unprivileged Belligerents

Unprivileged belligerents include civilians who take a direct part in hostilities, and members of armed groups that
fail to meet the criteria for lawful combatant status. Unprivileged belligerents are not entitled to combatant
immunity or POW status. Although an unprivileged belligerentâ€™s act of conducting hostilities is not, per se, a
violation of international law, such war-like acts may be prosecuted as a matter of domestic law.
