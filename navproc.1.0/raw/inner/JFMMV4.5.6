24.6  WOODEN SEA CHEST FOUNDATIONS.
a. To prevent overheating of the wood filler blocks and wood cap blocks in sea chests,

the wood must be insulated from the metal fittings.  Use of delron sleeves or bushings
around the body of the through-hull fitting and around the bolt fastenings is one
Approved method.

b. A Cathodic Corrosion Control system using an impressed current through anodes
installed on boat bottoms isolates the anode fittings with the use of delron bushings
and by the application of a mastic material applied over bare wood in a 36‚Äù diameter
Area around the anode.

c. Replace wood fillers and caps that are badly decayed.  If repairs cannot be made
immediately, then treat the bad wood with a preservative or decay inhibitor to slow up
the rate of deterioration until the bad wood can be replaced.  When new fillers in the
Form of blocks and caps are fabricated, they should be treated with preservative prior
to installation and after the wood has been finally shaped and fitted.
