24.2  Wood decay.
24.2.1  Primary Causes.  Wood decay is caused by a fungus growth which breaks down the cell
structure within the wood.  This fungus thrives in fresh water but its growth is significantly
retarded by salt water.  Wood decay generally occurs in those spaces which are poorly ventilated
and where fresh water has gained access.  Poor drainage, allowing fresh water to stand, even in
small amounts, is particularly hazardous.  The primary causes of wood decay found in ships
using wood for hulls, decking and structures are identified as:
a. Insufficient ventilation and air circulation especially in spaces plagued by dampness

and high humidity (i.e., chill room platforms and areas around fresh water tanks).
b. Obstructed drainpipes, scuppers, limbers, and drain holes.
c. Uncaulked or poorly maintained deck seams, especially around plywood decking and

Deckhouse areas.
d. Washing down with fresh water.
e. Depressions in the deck from sanding which allows fresh water to stand.
f. Leaking plumbing especially in heads, water closets, and food preparation areas.
24.2.2  Recognition.  Decay in the deck and hull structure is often concealed and hard to detect.
It is usually not recognizable by visible fungus except in joints between surfaces.  Decay may be
suspected if paint coating is discolored or the wood surface is cupped.  The affected wood has a
pronounced stringy, fibrous appearance.  Thoroughly decayed wood is brittle which, when dry,
breaks easily across the grain with a distinct brash fracture and may crumble into powder.  Black
stains spreading along the grain from ferrous metal fastenings are usually a result of chemical
reactions instead of from decay fungi.  Testing procedures for suspected decay areas are detailed
in reference (a).
24.2.3  Preventive Measures.  Detailed preventive measures are described in reference (a).
General preventive measures for the reduction of wood decay are identified in the following
paragraphs, and should be accomplished by Ship’s Force.



                                           

       

a. Correct or remove all interference with complete water runoff.
b. Repair fresh water leaks in plumbing drains and fresh water supply systems.
c. Maintain ventilation system in proper operation.  Ensure ventilation system filters are

Kept clean, maintained clear of all foreign material, and ventilation terminals remain
open.

d. Carefully caulk and maintain deck seams, especially around plywood decking,
deckhouse, hull fittings and foundation areas.

e. In fair weather, open hatches and deck plates to supplement the air circulation.
f. Remove wet dunnage or shoring in below deck spaces and permit to dry.
g. Avoid washing down with fresh water.  Use only salt water due to its preservation

Values.
h. Wash down the ship or craft with salt water following periods of inclement weather to

eliminate fresh water and restore salt washed away by the rainfall.
i. Avoid heavy buildup of paint.
j. Check MCM bilges and accessible voids for standing fluids once each watch.  Identify

and correct any leaks and promptly remove any fluids.  MCMs are designed to operate
with dry bilges.  Prolonged contact with fluids will result in wood swell, which can
lead to external glass reinforced plastic delamination, planking damage, and
machinery misalignment.

24.2.4  Corrective Measures.
a. Treat new wood, used during new construction or in repaired areas, with a copper

naphthenate preservative.  This product is produced in a clear and colorless form or in
a bright green color.  The green preservative has a higher level of copper and is
considered to be the more durable and efficient of the two preservatives.  If the treated
wood is to be varnished, finished with light-colored paints or left bare, use the clear
preservative since the green color will bleed through varnishes and light-colored
paints.

b. Build up a heavy concentration of the preservative with a series of three or more heavy
applications using a brush, spray or immersing the wood in a preservative filled tank.
On-going protection requires periodic application of the preservative to bare wood
structures at about five-year intervals.  Wood treated on this basis will last indefinitely.

c. Early identification of decayed areas will allow damaged wood to be treated with an
anti-decay product that will harden up the soft wood and prevent the further spread of
decay.  The product, available commercially, is a two-part mixture with deep
penetrating properties that fills wood pores with a capillary action.

d. Before a wood structure is so badly decayed that its replacement is necessary, a
possible long lasting repair is made by drilling a series of 1/4" to 3/8" diameter holes
in and around the affected areas and gravity feeding the anti-decay mixture in
sufficient quantity to allow total penetration of the damaged area.  A guide for proper
application of this product is provided with each repair kit.  Avoid removing or



                               
           

       

disturbing bad wood during repairs, since the original wood, whether good or bad,
serves as a container for the product and preserves the shape and size of the affected
member.  Initial curing of the product takes place about one hour after application.
Total curing takes place after one week, at which time the treated wood resembles
petrified wood and the growth of rot in the treated area is effectively stopped.  Repairs
should be accomplished by Ship’s Force during regular maintenance periods.
