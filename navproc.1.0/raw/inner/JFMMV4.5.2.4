24.2.4  Corrective Measures.
a. Treat new wood, used during new construction or in repaired areas, with a copper

naphthenate preservative.  This product is produced in a clear and colorless form or in
a bright green color.  The green preservative has a higher level of copper and is
considered to be the more durable and efficient of the two preservatives.  If the treated
wood is to be varnished, finished with light-colored paints or left bare, use the clear
preservative since the green color will bleed through varnishes and light-colored
paints.

b. Build up a heavy concentration of the preservative with a series of three or more heavy
applications using a brush, spray or immersing the wood in a preservative filled tank.
On-going protection requires periodic application of the preservative to bare wood
structures at about five-year intervals.  Wood treated on this basis will last indefinitely.

c. Early identification of decayed areas will allow damaged wood to be treated with an
anti-decay product that will harden up the soft wood and prevent the further spread of
decay.  The product, available commercially, is a two-part mixture with deep
penetrating properties that fills wood pores with a capillary action.

d. Before a wood structure is so badly decayed that its replacement is necessary, a
possible long lasting repair is made by drilling a series of 1/4" to 3/8" diameter holes
in and around the affected areas and gravity feeding the anti-decay mixture in
sufficient quantity to allow total penetration of the damaged area.  A guide for proper
application of this product is provided with each repair kit.  Avoid removing or



                               
           

       

disturbing bad wood during repairs, since the original wood, whether good or bad,
serves as a container for the product and preserves the shape and size of the affected
member.  Initial curing of the product takes place about one hour after application.
Total curing takes place after one week, at which time the treated wood resembles
petrified wood and the growth of rot in the treated area is effectively stopped.  Repairs
should be accomplished by Shipâ€™s Force during regular maintenance periods.
