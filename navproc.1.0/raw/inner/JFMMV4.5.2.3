24.2.3  Preventive Measures.  Detailed preventive measures are described in reference (a).
General preventive measures for the reduction of wood decay are identified in the following
paragraphs, and should be accomplished by Shipâ€™s Force.



                                           

       

a. Correct or remove all interference with complete water runoff.
b. Repair fresh water leaks in plumbing drains and fresh water supply systems.
c. Maintain ventilation system in proper operation.  Ensure ventilation system filters are

Kept clean, maintained clear of all foreign material, and ventilation terminals remain
open.

d. Carefully caulk and maintain deck seams, especially around plywood decking,
deckhouse, hull fittings and foundation areas.

e. In fair weather, open hatches and deck plates to supplement the air circulation.
f. Remove wet dunnage or shoring in below deck spaces and permit to dry.
g. Avoid washing down with fresh water.  Use only salt water due to its preservation

Values.
h. Wash down the ship or craft with salt water following periods of inclement weather to

eliminate fresh water and restore salt washed away by the rainfall.
i. Avoid heavy buildup of paint.
j. Check MCM bilges and accessible voids for standing fluids once each watch.  Identify

and correct any leaks and promptly remove any fluids.  MCMs are designed to operate
with dry bilges.  Prolonged contact with fluids will result in wood swell, which can
lead to external glass reinforced plastic delamination, planking damage, and
machinery misalignment.
