6.2.3.3.1  Receipt Inspection of Nuclear Material.  Controlled material for nuclear applications is
designated as Nuclear LI.  Reference (c) discusses the Nuclear Systems and the associated Level
of Essentiality as either Nuclear LI or Level-none.  Project Target Ready for Issue (RFI) tag
(NAVSEA 9210/2, Figure 6-1 of this chapter or NAVSEA 9210/2, Figure 6-2 of this chapter)
will be attached to all SMIC X1, X2 or X4 Nuclear LI RFI material.  X1 material components
and repair parts furnished by NAVSEA 08 prime contractor may not have RFI tags attached;
however, this material is considered pre-certified and ready for use.  The RFI tags depicted in
Figure 6-3 and Figure 6-4 of this chapter will be attached to Nuclear LI or non-LI material,
respectively, previously inspected by a Naval shipyard.  SMIC X6 components and repair parts
will not have RFI tags attached.  X6 includes material formerly classified as X3 and X5 items
that were procured as LI Material per NAVSEA 0900-070-6010.  Additionally, material may be
received with other tags (e.g., hydrostatic test tags per reference (i)).
a. Project Target is a NAVSEA nuclear material procurement program.
b. NAVSEA Prime Contractor.  Material supplied by NAVSEA prime contractors may

or may not have an RFI tag attached, but such material should be receipt inspected and
handled the same as material received with an RFI tag.  Material supplied by
NAVSEA prime contractors is identified by a 2S cognizance or X1 SMIC NSN and
N00024 in the contract number.

c. It should be noted that reference (a) only contains requirements for nuclear piping
system MIC.  Nuclear piping system material requirements (e.g., cleanliness,
dimensions, surface finish) and requirements to perform technical inspections per the
applicable material technical manuals are not included in reference (a).
