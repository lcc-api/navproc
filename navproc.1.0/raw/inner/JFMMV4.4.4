22.4  Procedure.
a. Upon completion of maintenance and before underway for submerged operations, the

ship must place CAUTION tags on the Main Power Switch or transmit keys for the
affected antennas.  The Amplifying Instructions for the CAUTION tags will state -
“DO NOT OPERATE OR TRANSMIT ON THIS ANTENNA UNTIL
COMPLETION OF PASSIVE CHECKS FOLLOWING A DIVE TO TEST DEPTH.
PASSIVE CHECKS MUST BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH USE UNTIL THE
DEEP DIVE IS COMPLETE.”

b. It is understood that in some cases, due to water depth restrictions, the deep dive may
not be performed for quite some time.  In these cases, the ship should dive to the
maximum depth possible and conduct passive checks.  Provided the checks are
satisfactory, the CAUTION tag may be replaced with one stating - “DO NOT
OPERATE OR TRANSMIT ON THIS ANTENNA FOLLOWING OPERATIONS
GREATER THAN (enter max depth obtained).  PASSIVE CHECKS MUST BE
PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH USE UNTIL THE DEEP DIVE IS
COMPLETED.”



                                           

       

c. The tag(s) may be removed following completion of a deep dive to test depth and
completion of satisfactory passive testing performed following the system specific
technical manuals or Maintenance Index Pages and MRCs to ensure the system is not
grounded.
