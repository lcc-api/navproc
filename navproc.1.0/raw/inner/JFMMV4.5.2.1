24.2.1  Primary Causes.  Wood decay is caused by a fungus growth which breaks down the cell
structure within the wood.  This fungus thrives in fresh water but its growth is significantly
retarded by salt water.  Wood decay generally occurs in those spaces which are poorly ventilated
and where fresh water has gained access.  Poor drainage, allowing fresh water to stand, even in
small amounts, is particularly hazardous.  The primary causes of wood decay found in ships
using wood for hulls, decking and structures are identified as:
a. Insufficient ventilation and air circulation especially in spaces plagued by dampness

and high humidity (i.e., chill room platforms and areas around fresh water tanks).
b. Obstructed drainpipes, scuppers, limbers, and drain holes.
c. Uncaulked or poorly maintained deck seams, especially around plywood decking and

Deckhouse areas.
d. Washing down with fresh water.
e. Depressions in the deck from sanding which allows fresh water to stand.
f. Leaking plumbing especially in heads, water closets, and food preparation areas.
