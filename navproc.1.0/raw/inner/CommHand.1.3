2.2.3 Crew Lists and Inspections

U.S. policy prohibits providing a list of crew members (to include military and nonmilitary personnel) or any
other passengers on board a USS or USCGC vessel as a condition of entry into a port or to satisfy local
immigration officials upon arrival. For more information concerning U.S. policy in this regard
see CNO WASHINGTON, DC 071719Z JUL 16 (NAVADMIN 158/16).

It is U.S. policy to refuse host government requests to conduct inspections of U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels,
conduct health inspections of crew members, provide specific information on individual crew members (including
providing access to a crew member’s medical record or the completion of an individual health questionnaire), or
undertake other requested actions beyond the commanding officer’s certification. In response to questions
concerning the presence of infectious diseases on visiting U.S. Navy ships, the U.S. diplomatic post may inform
host governments that a commanding officer of a U.S. Navy ship is required under Navy Regulations to report at
once to local health authorities any condition aboard the ship which presents a hazard of introduction of a
communicable disease outside the ship. The commanding officer, if requested, may certify that there are no
indications that personnel entering the host State from the ship will present such hazard.
