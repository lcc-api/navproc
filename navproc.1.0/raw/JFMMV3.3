3.4.2.1  Voyage Repair Availability Execution.
3.4.2.1.1  Naval Regional Contract Detachment.  The NRCD representative will award the
contract and liaison with the contractor on contractual matters, including new work and payment.
3.4.2.1.2  Arrival.  The RMC Surveyor will meet ship on arrival and ensure contracts are in place
prior to the commencement of work.  The Surveyor will ensure the technical portion of the
contract is satisfied and will liaison with local industrial activity on technical matters.  It is both
the Surveyor and Ship’s Force responsibility to ensure the contractor complies with work
Specifications.
3.4.2.1.3  Pre-Production Meeting.  After the contractor ship-check, an arrival conference will be
scheduled, during which the surveyor and Ship’s Force will review the specifications, ship-
contractor coordination requirements, QA requirements, and required government furnished
material to be provided by the ship.  The ship must provide the Surveyor a list of the ship’s QAIs
to be used during the availability.



                                           

       

3.4.2.1.4  Daily Production Meeting.  The RMC Surveyor, Ship’s Maintenance Management
Officer, and other personnel as necessary will meet daily, as a minimum, to review progress with
the intent being to identify possible problem areas that may require specific attention.  The
overall success and effectiveness of any availability is almost entirely a reflection of the
customer ship’s interest in the work being accomplished.
3.4.2.1.5  Growth and New Work.
a. Growth work identified during the open and inspect phase of the baseline repairs will

be reviewed for cost and schedule impacts and incorporated in the work package by
the Surveyor, as applicable.  No growth work or new work is authorized to commence
until FLC-NRCD negotiates with the contractor and the appropriate contract
documentation is issued.

b.  New work must be processed and authorized without violating Public Law
restrictions.  To assure these restrictions are not violated, the ship must submit an
OPNAV 4790/2K following the normal process and provide a copy to the Surveyor.
The Surveyor must determine the feasibility of completing new work and must obtain
the required authorization from the Maintenance Manager.

3.4.2.1.6  Constructive Changes.  Constructive changes are changes to contracts in the intent of
work specifications directed at the contractor by anyone other than the Surveyor or FLC-NRCD
representative.  Since they are not pre-negotiated with the contractor, constructive changes are
against the law.  Ship’s Force personnel should be cautioned not to direct or otherwise influence
contractor personnel to accomplish work not clearly delineated by contract specifications.
3.4.2.1.7  Contractor Support.
a. Material Support.  Military Specification parts and material are often not available to

local contractors.  Some parts can be manufactured, but the ship should provide the
material and parts required for work package execution.  The ship should provide only
the parts required by the work specifications.

b. Technical Support.  Drawings and Technical Manuals are generally not available in
theater.  Ship’s Force should be prepared to produce associated technical information
as required.

3.4.2.1.8  Schedule Limitations.
a. In the COMFIFTHFLT AOR, the Arab workweek is Saturday through Wednesday

with the weekend being on Thursday and Friday.  Ships in VR Availabilities should
support this schedule for the most productive use of the maintenance period.

b. In Israel, the weekend is on Friday and Saturday.  Ships in VR Availabilities should
support this schedule for the most productive use of the maintenance period.

c. Contractor ability to accomplish work is sometimes limited by Port Captain
regulations, local strikes, and holidays.  These stoppages are relatively frequent but
short term in nature.  The FLC-NRCD representative and RMC Surveyor should be
notified immediately of any indication of problems.

3.4.2.1.9  Quality Assurance Responsibilities.  Although the name implies quick repairs, VRs
require no less stringent QA procedures than any other routine planned repair.  While Ship’s



                               
           

       

Force is ultimately responsible for ensuring that appropriate QA is maintained on all repairs,
regardless of who performs the work, the Surveyor overseeing the VRs is responsible to Ship’s
Force to ensure that all requirements specified in the contract are met.  Specific Ship’s Force QA
responsibilities may include:
a. Providing personnel to witness tests and inspections as required by the Surveyor.

Witnesses must be qualified QAIs who are aware of the technical requirements to be
fulfilled by the test or inspection.

b. Ensuring that documentation of each contractor test or inspection is provided to the
QAI at its conclusion.  If not provided, the QAI will use the applicable form from
Volume V, Part I, Chapter 11 of this manual to document the test or inspection.
Records of all Ship’s Force and contractor tests and inspections will be maintained per
Volume V, Part I, Chapter 10 of this manual.

c. Insisting on verbatim compliance with the work specification, through the QAI, during
the test or inspection.  The QAI will immediately inform the appropriate Department
Head and Surveyor of any discrepancies noted.

d. Ensuring that any material provided by Ship’s Force by direction of the work
specification is in strict accordance with technical requirements.

e. Ensuring that no other material, tools, or physical assistance is provided to the
contractor unless it is specifically required by the contract specification or requested
by the Surveyor.  The entire Ship’s Force will be briefed on this prior to the start of the
VR period.

f. Assisting the Surveyor in providing continual in-process inspections of work being
accomplished aboard ship.  In-process inspections of work accomplished off-ship will
be accomplished as deemed necessary by the Department Heads and as agreed to by
the Surveyor.

g. Providing ship-specific operating and design system parameters to aid in determining
actual testing requirements.  Reporting specified test results on appropriate QA forms
to the Surveyor prior to the end of the VR period.

h. Providing all MIC LEVEL I material required to the Surveyor.  Material will not be
accepted unless properly controlled by Ship’s Force.  A face-to-face turnover by a
designated Controlled Material Petty Officer to the Surveyor is required.

3.4.2.1.10  Unsatisfactory Work or Work Practices.  Any unsatisfactory work accomplished or
work practice conducted by any maintenance activity must be promptly reported to the activity
involved and the applicable Maintenance Manager.  Reports should include sufficient detail to
ensure timely and proper corrective action may be taken.  Prior to informing the Maintenance
Manager, direct liaison between customer and repair activity in identifying and clarifying
deficiencies is required.
3.4.2.1.11  Post-Production Meeting.  The Surveyor will provide to Ship’s Force all appropriate
documentation, including objective quality evidence, to verify that the VRs were satisfactorily
completed.  As necessary, technical justification will be provided when a Departure from
Specification request is required to be submitted.



                                           

       

3.4.2.1.12  Assessment Report.  Following the completion of the VR Availability, Ship’s Force
must generate and transmit a Post-VR Assessment Report for transmission via message or e-
mail.
