3.11.2.3 Enforcement Jurisdiction Over Vessels Without Nationality

Vessels that are not legitimately registered in any one State are without nationality, and are often referred to as
“stateless vessels.” They are not entitled to fly the flag of any State and, because they are not entitled to the
protection of any State, they are subject to the jurisdiction of all States. U.S. case law, for instance, has expressly
held that “because stateless vessels do not fall within the veil of another sovereign’s territorial protection, all
nations can treat them as their own territory and subject them to their laws.” Accordingly, stateless vessels may be
boarded upon being encountered in international waters by a warship or other government vessel, and subjected to
all appropriate law enforcement actions. Other conduct that could lead a vessel to be treated as one without
nationality includes:

1. The vessel displays no name, flag, or other identifying characteristics

2. The master or person in charge, upon request, makes no claim of nationality or registry for that vessel

3. The claim of registry or the vessel’s display of registry is either denied or not affirmatively and
unequivocally confirmed by the State whose registry is claimed.
