4.9  REGIONAL MAINTENANCE CENTER ACTIONS UPON RECEIPT OF WORK
REQUESTS.  Upon receipt of a work request from another government agency, the RMC
Planning Supervisor or the individual designated by the Planning Supervisor, as the potential
project coordinator, will distribute copies to individual planners who have previously been
assigned cognizance over repair work in specific trade categories (e.g., hull, machinery, etc.) for
the specific ship.  The work item planner should initiate action at this time to obtain required
Drawings and other technical information necessary for the preparation of work item



                               
           

        

specifications or for inclusion in the work package that will be issued in the job order.  In many
cases, it will not be feasible to do this until after the planning inspection when the planner
Determines the drawings or technical information that will be required based on inspection of the
equipment.
a. When the scope of work can be anticipated with reasonable accuracy before the

planning inspection, the planner may be able to utilize the Master Specification
Catalog to prepare the specification and initiate advance requisitions for GFM required
for the work.  As in the case of drawings and technical information, however, it will
often be difficult to make a final determination in this respect until after the planning
inspection.

b. The planner must review previously prepared work items to ascertain if any work item
is similar to the work requested.  If the unit has previously been through an
availability, a review of the work items accomplished during that availability could be
of assistance in determining the extent of work which may be required to repair a
system or a piece of equipment.  This is especially true if a piece of equipment must
be opened or a system tested by the contractor to ascertain the extent of the repairs.
As a result of this review of prior work, “open and inspect” or “test and report” work
items can be minimized.
