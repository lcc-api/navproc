5.6  POST DELIVERY DEFICIENCY ITEMS.  The CO is responsible for reporting deficiencies
not otherwise identified by INSURV, until the end of the SCN period per the following
procedures.  By using the same format for PDDI reporting as for INSURV items and by
extending the use of the Consolidated Report to include these items, the same management
attention is afforded to all construction deficiencies.
a. The following types of problems should be reported as PDDIs:
(1) Recurring failures in a piece of equipment or machinery such that the

reliability is considered unsatisfactory.
(2) Major equipment or component malfunction which requires outside assistance

to correct (vendor or industrial activity).
(3) Symptoms of major machinery problems which require investigation to

determine the extent of the problem.  (Improper temperatures, pressures,
leakage, vibration, noise, etc.).

(4) Insufficient supply support for specific equipment or machinery based on
operational experience.  Allowance deficiencies reported as PDDIs should be
supplemented by submission of Allowance Change Requests or Configuration
Change Reports as appropriate.

(5) Excessive or accelerated wear, erosion, or corrosion determined through
inspection.

(6) Improper bonding of preservation on surfaces that must be protected.
(7) Any casualty which results in a Casualty Report (CASREP).  Insert an

amplification data set immediately after the Parts Identification data set
consisting of “AMPN/PDDI: ___- ___//”, ensuring that the CASREP includes
all appropriate PDDI addressees.  A separate PDDI must also be submitted.

(8) Identification of any condition or defect which requires a Departure from
Specification request.

(9) Improper alignment, clearance, or resistance to ground which indicates an
unaccounted for change from baseline data.



                                           

     

(10) Significant internal and external valve leakage.  (Primary, seawater, steam, air,
hydraulics, etc.).

(11) Any significant AT or CT deficiency item reported corrected which has
recurred.  Refer to the AT or INSURV number in the text of the deficiency
Description.

(12) Any AT or CT deficiency item reported corrected by the shipbuilder which is
not considered by the ship to be complete.  Refer to the AT or INSURV
Number in the text of the deficiency description.

NOTE: DEFICIENCIES AND MATERIAL PROBLEMS WHICH ARE CORRECTED
BY SHIP’S FORCE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SHOULD NOT BE REPORTED
AS PDDIs.

b. Reporting.
(1) Between delivery and GMI or FCT, uncorrected deficiencies of the nature

described in paragraph 5.6 of this chapter should be documented in the Current
Ship’s Maintenance Project (CSMP) and presented to the INSURV Board for
consideration during GMI or FCT.

(2) Problems requiring corrective action prior to PSA, or of such significance that
planning will have to commence as early as possible, should be reported by
OPNAV 4790/2K without delay.  The OPNAV 4790/2K must contain the
sequential identification number of the PDDI and a brief description of the
problem being reported.  Multiple PDDIs per report are encouraged.  Items
reported by OPNAV 4790/2K should be included in the next regular PDDI
report.  The OPNAV 4790/2K should also be sent by message, or e-mail where
appropriate, and must be addressed to the Supervising Authority, with
information copies to the Navy Shipbuilding Program Manager, TYCOM
(N40), the ISIC, and NAVSEA 08 (for items with nuclear cognizance).

(3) Routine PDDIs must be reported by OPNAV 4790/2K and summarized at least
monthly after the GMI or FCT.

(4) All PDDIs must be assigned a sequential number identifying the item for
administrative purposes and a priority in the “ship” column of the 4760-1
Report.  This forms Part E of the Consolidated Report.  Report Form 4760-1
will be provided to the ship at the GMI or FCT Card Conference.

(5) Distribution of the PDDI report by the ship will be:
(a) Advance copy to the Supervising Authority.
(b) Advance copy to the Navy Shipbuilding Program Manager.  (Nuclear

deficiencies to NAVSEA 08).
(c) Copy to the ISIC.
(d) Original to the Supervising Authority via the TYCOM and the Navy

Shipbuilding Program Manager.



                                           

     

(6) All PDDIs must be assigned a Job Sequence Number (JSN) in the ship's JSN
log prior to input into the ship’s CSMP.  The CSMP summary line (Block 37,
OPNAV 4790/2K) will contain the PDDI sequential number for cross
reference.
