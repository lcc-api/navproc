7.11 BELLIGERENT PERSONNEL INTERNED BY A NEUTRAL GOVERNMENT
International law recognizes that neutral territory, being outside the region of war, offers a place of asylum to
individual members of belligerent forces and as a general rule requires the neutral government concerned to
prevent the return of such persons to their own forces. The neutral State must accord equal treatment to the
personnel of all the belligerent forces.



                                       

             

Belligerent combatants taken on board a neutral warship or military aircraft beyond neutral waters must be
interned by the neutral State. Civilians that are nationals of a belligerent State that are taken on board a neutral
warship or military aircraft in such circumstances are to be repatriated.

Aircrew of nonmedical belligerent military aircraft that land in neutral territory, whether intentionally or
unintentionally, must be interned by the neutral State.
