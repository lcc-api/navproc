(1) Waiver approval delegation is provided within this manual for specific situations involving individual
personnel waivers, such as Orientation Flights and Flight Time Waivers.  Where authorized, the aviation
TYCOMs (Commander, Naval Air Force, Pacific (CNAP) and Commander, Naval Air Force, Atlantic
(CNAL)), CMC, CNATRA, COMNAVAIRSYSCOM, MARFORPAC, and Commander, Naval Air Forces
Reserve (COMNAVAIRFORES), may grant waivers for assigned units.

(2) Commands indicated below in the first column of Figure 2-2 may grant waivers to the provisions of T/M/S
NATOPS Flight manuals in order to develop new procedures or when compliance increases the risk of a
required flight operation prior to initiating recommendations for permanent changes. This provision is not
intended to permit a waiver for the sole purpose of convenience to that command. Waiver authority may
be delegated in writing at the discretion of the empowered commands listed in the second column of
Figure 2-2.

(3) All waivers shall always indicate the purpose for which granted and include a time limit. If a waiver must
be continually renewed, it is a good indication that the particular procedure, requirement, or limitation
should be revised.
