Compendium of roe


1.   This Compendium provides rules for the drafting of ROE.  The rules are divided into
groups that deal with different areas of military activity.  Within these groups there are a
number of series of rules, each of which regulates a distinct activity.  Individual rules are
selected from the series as required. Spare numbers are provided for the drafting of rules
not included in the Compendium.   Some of the rules include the term â€•(SPECIFY).    This
means that detail must be inserted to clarify the meaning of the rule.

2.   The Handbook is constructed on the basis that the right to use force in individual
self-defence or unit self-defence is not limited unless a rule in Groups 10-19 specifically
does so.

3.   The process for drafting ROE from this Compendium is set out below and
summarized in the ROE Drafting Check List.

a.   Analyse the mission.  Pay particular attention to the policy, operational and
legal considerations that may affect ROE, including higher authority intent or
guidance.  Determine the character of the operation as involving armed conflict
(international or non-international) or as falling outside armed conflict in order to
determine the applicable rules.

b.   Identify tasks from Mission Statement in OPORD.  The OPORD will contain
the mission statement and military tasks that are to be completed to accomplish the
mission.  These tasks need to be identified before any consideration can be given to
drafting ROE.

c.  Identify any current ROE.  This is necessary to determine if changes will be
required.

d.  Prepare the ROE. .


i. Identify Compulsory Rules.   The first ROE to be considered are the
compulsory rules. The compulsory rules deal with matters that are
fundamental to any mission and must be present in every ROE, even if the
rule selected is one that prohibits the military activity.  Every ROE is to
include a rule from each of series 10, 11, 12, 60 & 70. For any mission
beyond self-defence, a rule from series 20 is required.  In situations involving
armed conflict, measures from series 30 and 32 are required.

ii. Identify Environment-Specific Rules.  Appendix 2 to Annex A provides
guidance for drafting ROE for environments including land, maritime, air,
outer space, and cyberspace operations.  The rules that are most likely to be
required are set out for each environment but are not compulsory.

iii. Identify Task Specific Rules.  Appendix 3 to Annex A provides
guidance for drafting ROE for specific tasks including peace operations, non-
combatant evacuation operations, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief,



       



  

 

and assistance to civil authorities.  The rules that are most likely to be
required are set out for each environment but are not compulsory.

iv. Review remaining rules in Compendium.  Each mission is unique so
the environment and task specific guidance will not always be sufficient.
ROE drafters should check all the series in the Compendium to see if any
other rules are required to accomplish the mission.


v. Draft rules.  The ROE message should be drafted with ROE listed in
numerical order.  It is possible, and sometimes necessary, to have two rules
chosen from the same series.

vi. Draft spare rules, if required.  The Compendium cannot anticipate
every possible mission and rule that may be required.  Where a rule is not
provided, it can be drafted under a spare number using the same format as
Other rules in that series or as part of a new group or series.

vii. Determine Retained Rules.  Decide which rules, if any, are to be
retained at a higher level.  These rules will remain dormant until a ROEIMP
message is issued.


e.    Validate ROE by comparing to tasks.  The ROE must be checked against the
mission and task to ensure that it supports mission accomplishment within the
limitations set out by higher authority.  Rectify shortfalls, if any.

f.  Obtain approval.  Seek approval from the appropriate level of authority.
