32.5.1.3  Ranking Matrix Calculation.  Data for each attribute are scaled, normalized or
standardized (depending on the language in your field of study) in a way that creates unit vectors



                               
           

       

(0 to 1, with a few high outliers > 1) in statistical units (Standard Deviation multiples sometime
referred to as “Z” scores).  The scaling used results in the 3-sigma value of the data being scaled
to equal one.  The 99.86th percentile of the data is used to locate that value in the ranked raw
data, which is a percentile commonly used for “normal” distributions with a single tail as being
equivalent to the 3-sigma value.  Although the five attribute distributions are not “normal”, they
are close to being “log normal” so the percentile technique works.  The percentile technique
works well regardless since the data is a 100% sample and the statistical distribution (which
should be known if samples are used for estimating) is not a critical issue.  After scaling the
attributes, the vector equivalents are then combined using vector addition to create a balanced
rank value that can be used for final ordering of the ranking.  The vector addition technique is
straightforward (Pythagorean).  For over three years this has produced a tight pattern of the top
ten for each attribute falling within the top 50 fleet-wide.  The method is objective, repeatable,
and robust and uses the “actual data”, not a representation of the data.
