b. Non-FDNF Voyage Repairs Only.  When AFMAs visit ports with substantial Naval
Repair facilities or are in commercial ports during times of high port loading, it is often
desirable to divide availabilities and primary work screening functions between the
shore activity and the AFMA on a ship-by-ship basis.  When this happens, the
applicable maintenance manager will, by message, assign the primary availability and
work package screening responsibility to either the shore activity or the AFMA.
When assigned, the primary activity will request and screen the work package.  The
primary activity will also screen work candidates for referral to the secondary activity
for review and acceptance or rejection.  The secondary activity will then issue its own
screening message concerning only the work candidates referred by the primary
activity.  Ports where this may be routinely expected to happen are:

PORT activity
Yokosuka SRF-JRMC
Sasebo SRF-JRMC Det
c. The following guidance applies to work to be accomplished by all maintenance

activities on ships not permanently homeported overseas:
(1) Work candidates which are clearly within the capability of Ship's Force will

Not normally be accomplished by repair activities, but technical assistance will
be provided if the need is substantiated.

(2) Work candidates for material only or manufacture of standard stock items will
not be approved, unless the item is not available in time to ensure timely
correction of Casualty Reports or major safety items only.

(3) Unless previously authorized by the Type Commander, work candidates for
ship changes will not normally be approved while deployed.



                                           

       

(4) Activities authorized to accomplish work screening will use screening
messages prepared per Appendix A of this chapter, or via E-mail (SIPRNET or
NIPRNET) as applicable.
