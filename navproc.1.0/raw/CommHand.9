8.11 Information Operations

IO is the integrated employment, during military operations, of information-related capabilities in concert with
other lines of operation to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision making of adversaries and potential
adversaries while protecting our own. For the purpose of this discussion on targeting considerations the military
capabilities that contribute to IO include cyberspace operations (CO), information assurance, space operations,
military information support operations (MISO) (formerly known as psychological operations), intelligence,
military deception, operations security, special technical operations, joint electromagnetic spectrum operations.
(See Joint Publication (JP) 3-13, Information Operations, for a broader discussion of this subject.)

8.11.1 General Information Operations Targeting Considerations

Legal analysis of intended wartime targets requires traditional law of war analysis. Offensive IO can target human
decision processes (human factors), the information and information systems used to support decision making
(links), and the information and information systems used to process information and implement decisions
(nodes). Offensive IO efforts should examine all three target areas to maximize the opportunity for success.
Human factors include national command authorities, commanders, forces, the populace as a whole and/or groups
within the populace. In all cases, the selection of offensive IO targets must be consistent with United States
objectives, applicable international conventions, the law of armed conflict, and ROE. Department of Defense IO
activities will not be directed at or intended to manipulate audiences, public actions, or opinions in the United
States and will be conducted in accordance with all applicable U.S. statutes, codes, and laws.

8.11.2 Physical Attack/Destruction

The legal requirement to attack only military objectives and to avoid excessive incidental injury/death and
collateral damage to noncombatants, civilians, and civilian objects applies when identifying targets for physical
attack/destruction as part of an offensive IO plan. Information operations that do not entail the risk of physical
injury or death to protected persons or damage to civilian objects may be targeted at noncombatants and civilians.

8.11.3 Military Information Support Operations

MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their
emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations,
groups, and individuals in a manner favorable to the originator’s objectives. MISO must not be confused with
psychological impact. U.S. MISO will not target U.S. citizens under any circumstances.



                                       

             

8.11.4 Offensive Cyberspace Operations

Offensive cyberspace operations (OCO) are cyberspace operations intended to project power by the application of
force in or through cyberspace. OCO can be accomplished by lethal and nonlethal means. In employing nonlethal
means of OCO against a military objective, factors involved in weighing anticipated incidental injury/death to
protected persons can include, depending on the target, indirect effects (for example, the anticipated incidental
injury/death that may occur from disrupting an electric generating plant that supplies power to a military
headquarters and to a hospital).

Department of Defense doctrine describes cyberspace as a “global domain within the information environment
consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the
Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”

There are no international agreements that directly address cyberspace in the context of military operations and
state practice is only starting to emerge. Nonetheless, if a cyber operation constitutes a military operation in an
armed conflict, then the laws of armed conflict apply. In particular, if a cyber operation constitutes an armed
attack, then the law of armed conflict and all of its principles apply to that operation.
