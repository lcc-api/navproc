1.4.4  Guidelines.
a. Validation, screening and brokering will be accomplished continuously.  The Ship

Material Maintenance Officer will provide recommendations to the Ashore Ship’s
Maintenance Manager.  The Ashore Ship’s Maintenance Manager will use these
guidelines to screen and broker work candidates to the proper availability:

b. All work will be screened to an availability created and numbered per the business
rules in Appendix A of this chapter.

c. Work candidates will be screened to the following type of availabilities:  CNO,
Continuous Maintenance (CM), emergent or unfunded.  No other type of availability
will be used.

(1) CNO Availability.  The work candidate is best performed during the scheduled
CNO availability.  These work candidates include major Ship Alterations and
repairs that require support services and coordination.



                                           

         

(2) Continuous Maintenance Availability.  Based on ship availability, priority of
the job, business case analysis, periodicity or other consideration, the
maintenance should be performed during a scheduled Continuous Maintenance
Availability or during a window of opportunity permitted by ship’s schedule.

(3) Emergent Availability.  Emergent work is performed at greater cost than work
planned and completed in other availabilities.  The criteria to be used to qualify
work as emergent is provided in TYCOM business rules (e.g., Volume VI,
Chapter 31, Paragraph 31.3.3 of this manual for Surface Force ships).

(4) Unfunded Availability.  This availability is reserved for work candidates,
which should be shown as backlog or are of such low priority they are unlikely
ever to be accomplished.

d. Brokering must follow these requirements:
(1) Work candidates for technical assistance, assessment or inspection will be

brokered to the RMC Fleet Maintenance Activity or another technical activity.
(2) Work candidates will be brokered to the lowest level of maintenance activity,

filling Fleet Maintenance Activity capacity first, based on the following
criteria:

(a) Material availability.
(b) Capability:
1 Experience.
2 Available Production Resource Tools.
3 Available qualified and certified personnel.
4 Ability to comply with Environmental, Health and Safety

Regulations.
(c) Work center capacity.
(d) Funding.
