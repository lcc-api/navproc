  "raw" : "2.2 Warships\n\n2.2.1 Warship Defined\n\nInternational law defines a warship as a ship belonging to the armed forces of a State bearing the external\nmarkings distinguishing the character and nationality of such ships, under the command of an officer duly\ncommissioned by the government of that State and whose name appears in the appropriate service list of officers,\nand manned by a crew that is under regular armed forces discipline. Warships maintain their status even if\ncivilians form part of the crew. Ships need not be armed in order to qualify as warships. In the U.S. Navy, those\nships designated “USS” are “warships” as defined by international law. U.S. Coast Guard vessels designated\n“USCGC” under the command of a commissioned officer are also “warships” under international law.\n\n\n\n                                       \n\n            \n\nDuring international armed conflict at sea, warships are the only vessels that may exercise belligerent rights,\nwhich include the right to conduct offensive attacks. Other vessels, such as auxiliary vessels and merchant\nvessels, are not entitled to conduct attacks in offensive combat operations in an international armed conflict. All\nvessels, however, may defend themselves (including resisting attacks by enemy forces). These limitations do not\napply to non-international armed conflicts.\n\n2.2.2 Warship International Status\n\nAs a matter of customary international law, warships enjoy sovereign immunity from interference by the\nauthorities of States other than the flag State. Police and port authorities may board a warship only with the\npermission of the commanding officer. A warship cannot be required to consent to an onboard search or\ninspection, nor may it be required to fly the flag of the host State. Although warships are required to comply with\ncoastal State traffic control, sewage, health, and quarantine restrictions instituted in conformance with the\nUNCLOS, a failure of compliance is subject only to diplomatic complaint or to coastal State orders to leave its\nterritorial sea immediately. Moreover, warships are immune from arrest and seizure, whether in national or\ninternational waters, and are exempt from foreign taxes and regulation and exercise exclusive control over all\npassengers and crew with regard to acts performed on board. U.S. Navy policy requires warships to assert the\nrights of sovereign immunity.\n\n2.2.3 Crew Lists and Inspections\n\nU.S. policy prohibits providing a list of crew members (to include military and nonmilitary personnel) or any\nother passengers on board a USS or USCGC vessel as a condition of entry into a port or to satisfy local\nimmigration officials upon arrival. For more information concerning U.S. policy in this regard\nsee CNO WASHINGTON, DC 071719Z JUL 16 (NAVADMIN 158/16).\n\nIt is U.S. policy to refuse host government requests to conduct inspections of U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels,\nconduct health inspections of crew members, provide specific information on individual crew members (including\nproviding access to a crew member’s medical record or the completion of an individual health questionnaire), or\nundertake other requested actions beyond the commanding officer’s certification. In response to questions\nconcerning the presence of infectious diseases on visiting U.S. Navy ships, the U.S. diplomatic post may inform\nhost governments that a commanding officer of a U.S. Navy ship is required under Navy Regulations to report at\nonce to local health authorities any condition aboard the ship which presents a hazard of introduction of a\ncommunicable disease outside the ship. The commanding officer, if requested, may certify that there are no\nindications that personnel entering the host State from the ship will present such hazard.\n\n2.2.4 Quarantine\n\nArticle 0859, U.S. Navy Regulations, 1990, requires that the commanding officer or aircraft commander of a ship\nor aircraft comply with quarantine regulations and restrictions. While commanding officers and aircraft\ncommanders shall not permit inspection of their vessel or aircraft, they shall afford every other assistance to\nhealth officials, U.S. or foreign, and shall give all information required, insofar as permitted by the requirements\nof military necessity and security. To avoid restrictions imposed by quarantine regulations, the commanding\nofficer should request free pratique (clearance granted a ship to proceed into a port after compliance with health or\nquarantine regulations) in accordance with the sailing directions for that port.\n\n2.2.5 Nuclear-Powered Warships\n\nNuclear-powered warships and conventionally powered warships enjoy identical international legal status.",
