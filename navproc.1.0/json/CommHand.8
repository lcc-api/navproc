  "raw" : "8.6.3.1 Hospital Ships, Medical Transports, and Medical Aircraft\n\nProperly designated and marked hospital ships, medical transports, and medical aircraft, as well as coastal rescue\ncraft are exempt from destruction or capture. A hospital ship’s medical personnel and crew must not be attacked\nor captured even if there are no sick or wounded on board. Names and descriptions of hospital ships must be\nprovided to the parties to the conflict not later than 10 days before they are first employed. Thereafter, hospital\nships must be used exclusively to assist, treat, and transport the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. All exterior\nsurfaces of hospital ships are painted white and the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross or Red Crescent is\ndisplayed on the hull and on horizontal surfaces.\n\nIn the actual employment of hospital ships, the application of some previously well-established principles has\nadapted to reflect the realities of modern circumstances. Traditionally, hospital ships could not be armed, although\ncrew members could carry light individual weapons for the maintenance of order, for their own defense and that\nof the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. However, due to the current threat environment in which the red cross\nsymbol is not recognized by various hostile groups and actors as indicating protected status, the United States\nviews the manning of hospital ships with defensive weapons systems, such as antimissile defense systems or\ncrew-served weapons to defend against small boat threats as prudent AT/FP measures, analogous to arming crew\nmembers with small arms, and consistent with the humanitarian purpose of hospital ships and duty to safeguard\nthe wounded and sick. Additionally, weapons and ammunition taken from the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked,\nmay also be retained on board for eventual turn-over to proper authority.\n\n\n\n                                       \n\n             \n\nFurther, Article 34, Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and\nShipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949, provides that hospital ships may not use or\npossess “secret codes” as means of communication so that belligerents could verify that hospital ships’\ncommunications systems were being used only in support of their humanitarian function and not as a means of\ncommunicating information that would be harmful to the enemy. However, subsequent technological advances in\nencryption and satellite navigation, while recognized as legally problematic, have not been specifically addressed\nby treaty. As a practical matter, modern navigational technology requires that the traditional rule prohibiting\n“secret codes” be understood to not include modern communications encryption systems. However, such systems\nmust not be used for military purposes in any way harmful to a potential adversary.\n\nMedical aircraft, whether civilian or military, and whether permanently or temporarily so employed, must be used\nexclusively for the removal and transportation of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked, or for the transportation of\nmedical personnel or medical equipment. They shall not be armed nor configured for reconnaissance. Medical\naircraft shall contain no armament other than small arms and ammunition belonging to the wounded and sick or\nnecessary for the defense of the wounded and sick and the medical personnel. Medical aircraft must also not be used\nto collect or transmit intelligence data since they must not be used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts\nharmful to the enemy. This prohibition, however, does not preclude the presence or use on board medical aircraft of\ncommunications equipment and encryption materials solely to facilitate navigation, identification, or communication\nin support of medical operations. Medical aircraft should be clearly marked with the emblem of the Red Cross,\nRed Crescent, or Red Crystal. Failure to so mark them risks having them not recognized as protected platforms.\n\nHospital ships, medical transports, and medical aircraft utilized solely for medical purposes and recognized as\nsuch, whether or not marked with the appropriate emblem, are not to be deliberately attacked. Before making\nflights bringing medical aircraft within range of the enemy’s surface-to-air weapons systems the enemy should be\nnotified with a view to ensuring such aircraft will not be attacked. Aeromedical evacuation also may, of course, be\nconducted by combat-equipped helicopters and airplanes. They are not, however, exempt from attack, and fly at\ntheir own risk of being attacked.\n\nHospital ships can leave port even if the port falls into enemy hands. Hospital ships are not classified as warships\nwith regard to the length of their stay in neutral ports.\n\nHospital ships must not be used for any other purpose during the conflict, particularly in an attempt to shield\nmilitary objectives from attack. To ensure this, an opposing force may visit and search hospital ships, put on\nboard a commissioner temporarily or put on neutral observers, detain the ship for no more than 7 days (if required\nby the gravity of the circumstances), and control the ship’s means of communications. The opposing force may\nalso order hospital ships to depart, make them take a certain course, or refuse assistance to them.\n\nA warship may demand the surrender of enemy military wounded, sick, and shipwrecked personnel found in\nhospital ships and other craft provided they are in a fit state to be moved and that the warship can provide\nadequate facilities for necessary medical treatment.\n\nSick bays and their medical personnel aboard other naval vessels must also be respected by boarding parties and\nspared as much as possible. They remain subject to the laws of warfare, but cannot be diverted from their medical\npurposes if required for the care of the wounded or sick. If a naval commander can ensure the proper care of the\nsick and wounded, and if there is urgent military necessity, sick bays may be used for other purposes.\n\nMedical aircraft must comply with a request to land for inspection. These requests are to be given in accordance\nwith ICAO standard procedures for interception of civil aircraft. Medical aircraft complying with such a request\nto land must be allowed to continue their flight, with all personnel on board belonging to their forces, to neutral\ncountries, or to countries not a party to the conflict, so long as inspection does not reveal that the aircraft was\nengaging in acts harmful to the inspecting force or otherwise violating the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Persons\nof the nationality of the inspecting force found on board may be taken off and retained.",
