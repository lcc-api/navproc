By using the same format for PDDI reporting as for INSURV items and by extending the use of the Consolidated Report to include these items, the same management attention is afforded to all construction deficiencies. a. The following types of problems should be reported as PDDIs: (1) Recurring failures in a piece of equipment or machinery such that the reliability is considered unsatisfactory. (2) Major equipment or component malfunction which requires outside assistance to correct (vendor or industrial activity). (3) Symptoms of major machinery problems which require investigation to determine the extent of the problem. (Improper temperatures, pressures, leakage, vibration, noise, etc.). (4) Insufficient supply support for specific equipment or machinery based on operational experience. Allowance deficiencies reported as PDDIs should be supplemented by submission of Allowance Change Requests or Configuration Change Reports as appropriate. (5) Excessive or accelerated wear, erosion, or corrosion determined through inspection. (6) Improper bonding of preservation on surfaces that must be protected. (7) Any casualty which results in a Casualty Report (CASREP). Insert an amplification data set immediately after the Parts Identification data set consisting of “AMPN/PDDI: ___- ___//”, ensuring that the CASREP includes all appropriate PDDI addressees. A separate PDDI must also be submitted. (8) Identification of any condition or defect which requires a Departure from Specification request. (9) Improper alignment, clearance, or resistance to ground which indicates an unaccounted for change from baseline data. (10) Significant internal and external valve leakage. (Primary, seawater, steam, air, hydraulics, etc.). (11) Any significant AT or CT deficiency item reported corrected which has recurred. Refer to the AT or INSURV number in the text of the deficiency Description. (12) Any AT or CT deficiency item reported corrected by the shipbuilder which is not considered by the ship to be complete. Refer to the AT or INSURV Number in the text of the deficiency description. NOTE: DEFICIENCIES AND MATERIAL PROBLEMS WHICH ARE CORRECTED BY SHIP’S FORCE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SHOULD NOT BE REPORTED AS PDDIs. b. Reporting.
