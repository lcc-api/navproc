Sustaining Activities will conduct internal surveys per section 4.1.2 of reference (a) and: (1) If the SCA sustaining certification survey periodicity is 15 months or greater, perform at least two internal surveys between the SCA surveys, not to exceed a 12-month periodicity. (2) Prior to the SCA on-site survey, conduct an internal survey to evaluate compliance with certification requirements. (3) For other than overhaul or new construction, complete the Sustaining Activity's internal survey and submit it to the Program Manager per the applicable SOC notebook or reference (a) section 4.1.2. (4) Overhaul and New Construction. The activity’s internal survey must be completed not more than 30 days prior to the SCA survey and the results of the internal survey must be submitted to NAVSEA at least 10 working days prior to the start of the SCA survey. (5) Obtain NAVSEA approval of an updated Certification Survey Plan at least two weeks prior to the SCA survey for an SCA Certification Survey Only. g. Report to NAVSEA resolution of all survey deficiencies. h. Retain the completed maintenance and dive log, including, where required, pre-dive and post-dive check-off procedures for all evolutions from survey to survey. The procedures utilized must have prior Program Manager and SCA concurrence. i. Obtain NAVSEA approval for alterations to items within the SOC. This includes the addition of any mission-related equipment outside the defined lines of the DSS as deemed necessary by the SCA. j. Accomplish and report Maintenance Requirement Cards and Hull Integrity Procedures following the assigned periodicities approved by the Program Manager and immediately resolve any unacceptable conditions found as a result of conducting the maintenance procedures or inspections. k. Review and sign the MOA required by Volume II, Part I of this manual. This agreement, as a minimum, must define the activity's functions and responsibilities for implementing and administrating REC procedures. Volume II, Part I of this manual contains specific requirements for MOAs. All applicable activities must sign the MOA prior to the start of work. l. The User Activity must issue the DSS certification continuity report before manned operations (Not applicable when in pursuit of certification or reinstatement of certification per reference (a) paragraph 3.7.4.). For vehicles loaded on submarines, the certification continuity report must be issued prior to the underway of the host ship (not required to issue DSS certification continuity report for work performed at sea). m. Obtain formal approval for any temporary modifications prior to installation in a DSS from the Program Manager. Submit the request to the Program Manager and include the items listed in section 5.4.4 of reference (a) and any other items as required by the Program Manager. n.
