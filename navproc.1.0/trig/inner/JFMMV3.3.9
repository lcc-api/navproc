Insisting on verbatim compliance with the work specification, through the QAI, during the test or inspection. The QAI will immediately inform the appropriate Department Head and Surveyor of any discrepancies noted. d. Ensuring that any material provided by Ship’s Force by direction of the work specification is in strict accordance with technical requirements. e. Ensuring that no other material, tools, or physical assistance is provided to the contractor unless it is specifically required by the contract specification or requested by the Surveyor. The entire Ship’s Force will be briefed on this prior to the start of the VR period. f. Assisting the Surveyor in providing continual in-process inspections of work being accomplished aboard ship. In-process inspections of work accomplished off-ship will be accomplished as deemed necessary by the Department Heads and as agreed to by the Surveyor. g. Providing ship-specific operating and design system parameters to aid in determining actual testing requirements. Reporting specified test results on appropriate QA forms to the Surveyor prior to the end of the VR period. h. Providing all MIC LEVEL I material required to the Surveyor. Material will not be accepted unless properly controlled by Ship’s Force. A face-to-face turnover by a designated Controlled Material Petty Officer to the Surveyor is required.
