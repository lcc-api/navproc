This includes the addition of any mission-related equipment outside the defined lines of the DSS as deemed necessary by the SCA. j. Accomplish and report Maintenance Requirement Cards and Hull Integrity Procedures following the assigned periodicities approved by the Program Manager and immediately resolve any unacceptable conditions found as a result of conducting the maintenance procedures or inspections. k. Review and sign the MOA required by Volume II, Part I of this manual. This agreement, as a minimum, must define the activity's functions and responsibilities for implementing and administrating REC procedures. Volume II, Part I of this manual contains specific requirements for MOAs. All applicable activities must sign the MOA prior to the start of work. l. The User Activity must issue the DSS certification continuity report before manned operations (Not applicable when in pursuit of certification or reinstatement of certification per reference (a) paragraph 3.7.4.). For vehicles loaded on submarines, the certification continuity report must be issued prior to the underway of the host ship (not required to issue DSS certification continuity report for work performed at sea). m. Obtain formal approval for any temporary modifications prior to installation in a DSS from the Program Manager. Submit the request to the Program Manager and include the items listed in section 5.4.4 of reference (a) and any other items as required by the Program Manager. n. Operate the DSS within the limits specified as part of the requirements for each sustaining certification. o. The Sustaining Activity must report any violation of the DSS operating limits to NAVSEA stating the cause or justification for the violation. p. Keep the Program Manager and SCA advised of any failure or improper operation experienced by, or damages sustained to, any item or system within the SOC. q. The responsibilities listed in Part I, Chapter 1 Section 1.5 of this volume apply to the User or Sustaining Activity. Each activity must comply with the applicable responsibilities listed in this section. For instance, DSSs are responsible for the duties listed in the Ship Commanding Officer section. r. When the sustaining Activity is different than the user activity, the Sustaining Activity will issue a written report to the User Activity, with a copy to parent ISIC, which addresses the status of SOC RECs, testing of SOC systems, Hull Integrity Procedure maintenance requirements completed and DFS items. s. [[Ensure]] fact-finding critiques are held to establish underlying causes and pursue corrective actions when necessary.
