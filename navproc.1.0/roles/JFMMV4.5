[[As a general policy, because of the ever present risk of decay developing beneath any wood coating, leave wood strip planked decks uncoated and unpainted]]. b. Limit the cleaning of wood decks to scrubbing with mild detergents and salt water. Never use fresh water for wash-downs since it encourages growth of decay producing fungi. Do not use strong detergents, acids, and bleaches for deck cleaning. Do not sand decks. c. Set up a routine of daily wetting down of wood strip planked decks with salt water. This wetting down causes strip deck planking to remain swollen and creates a tighter fit between planks. Wetting down is especially necessary during warm weather periods when the sun’s heat will quickly dry out the deck planking. Do not allow water to accumulate in deck recesses for any length of time. d. Cover all plywood decks with a coating following the application and deck preparation procedures of reference (b). e. Planking renewal will be approved by the TYCOM only on the basis of a technical survey that has positively shown specific need and complete justification for such renewal. Often used general terms such as "Rotten and Worn" are not considered sufficient justification. The technical basis for planking renewal must be formed in the following manner: (1) Drill test bore holes in weather deck areas to find planking thickness in specific areas where plank wear is suspected. If the planking is not worn beyond the limits set forth in reference (b), the planking will not be renewed unless other extenuating and justifiable circumstances dictate, and replacement is authorized by the TYCOM. (2) Take boring plug samples of planking suspected of being decayed. Notify the TYCOM of inspection results. (3) Once planking has reached the maximum wear limits (found by bore test), the TYCOM will determine the need to replank or apply a deck coating. f. So far as practicable, repair deck leaks by recaulking deck seams. g. When deck planking wear limits have been reached, and other factors such as extensive deck leaks suggest use of a deck covering, a coating of polyurethane deck overlay may be used. Non-skid material must be Naval Sea Systems Command approved material compatible with the deck overlay as defined in reference (b). h. Reset metallic planking fasteners when fastener heads are level with, or protrude above, deck level. Where the planking level is within 1/4" or less of fastener head, filling with seam filler vice wooden plugging is authorized. Where bung plugs are installed, they must be set in black polyurethane seam filler per the requirements of reference (c). i. Ships currently having polysulfide or polyurethane coated strip deck planking in good condition must continue to use the applied covering. Make minor repairs to this polyurethane coating as necessary using either a polysulfide or polyurethane repair kit. When the polysulfide covering is no longer economically repairable, replace it with a polyurethane type coating. Repairing cracks and holes in impervious deck coatings must be accomplished as soon as practical. Failure to do so will lead to deck rot and costly repairs.

As a general policy, because of the ever present risk of decay developing beneath any wood coating, leave wood strip planked decks uncoated and unpainted. b. [[Limit the cleaning of wood decks to scrubbing with mild detergents and salt water]]. Never use fresh water for wash-downs since it encourages growth of decay producing fungi. Do not use strong detergents, acids, and bleaches for deck cleaning. Do not sand decks. c. Set up a routine of daily wetting down of wood strip planked decks with salt water. This wetting down causes strip deck planking to remain swollen and creates a tighter fit between planks. Wetting down is especially necessary during warm weather periods when the sun’s heat will quickly dry out the deck planking. Do not allow water to accumulate in deck recesses for any length of time. d. Cover all plywood decks with a coating following the application and deck preparation procedures of reference (b). e. Planking renewal will be approved by the TYCOM only on the basis of a technical survey that has positively shown specific need and complete justification for such renewal. Often used general terms such as "Rotten and Worn" are not considered sufficient justification. The technical basis for planking renewal must be formed in the following manner: (1) Drill test bore holes in weather deck areas to find planking thickness in specific areas where plank wear is suspected. If the planking is not worn beyond the limits set forth in reference (b), the planking will not be renewed unless other extenuating and justifiable circumstances dictate, and replacement is authorized by the TYCOM. (2) Take boring plug samples of planking suspected of being decayed. Notify the TYCOM of inspection results. (3) Once planking has reached the maximum wear limits (found by bore test), the TYCOM will determine the need to replank or apply a deck coating. f. So far as practicable, repair deck leaks by recaulking deck seams. g. When deck planking wear limits have been reached, and other factors such as extensive deck leaks suggest use of a deck covering, a coating of polyurethane deck overlay may be used. Non-skid material must be Naval Sea Systems Command approved material compatible with the deck overlay as defined in reference (b). h. Reset metallic planking fasteners when fastener heads are level with, or protrude above, deck level. Where the planking level is within 1/4" or less of fastener head, filling with seam filler vice wooden plugging is authorized. Where bung plugs are installed, they must be set in black polyurethane seam filler per the requirements of reference (c). i. Ships currently having polysulfide or polyurethane coated strip deck planking in good condition must continue to use the applied covering. Make minor repairs to this polyurethane coating as necessary using either a polysulfide or polyurethane repair kit. When the polysulfide covering is no longer economically repairable, replace it with a polyurethane type coating. Repairing cracks and holes in impervious deck coatings must be accomplished as soon as practical. Failure to do so will lead to deck rot and costly repairs.

Avoid application of heat on or near items such as electric wiring, plastics, gaskets, and all flammable materials. Use only enough heat as required to blister the paint. Excessive heat chars the wood fibers and removal of the charred wood results in an uneven surface. Remove all interferences that can reasonably be removed before applying heat. This includes all label plates, brackets, clips, etc. b. [[Scraping tools used to remove blistered paint must be kept sharp to be effective]]. Do all scraping in the direction of the wood grain to prevent shredding of wood fibers and gouging of the bare wood surface. This phase of paint removal is important in preparing the surface for sanding. c. All areas stripped as previously described are now ready for sanding before priming. Hand sanding, with wooden blocks where practicable, using the correct grit paper, is the prescribed final step.
