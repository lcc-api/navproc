The use of torches to blister the existing paint coating for removal is authorized; however, care must be taken to guard against damage to other items or equipment in the vicinity. Avoid application of heat on or near items such as electric wiring, plastics, gaskets, and all flammable materials. Use only enough heat as required to blister the paint. Excessive heat chars the wood fibers and removal of the charred wood results in an uneven surface. Remove all interferences that can reasonably be removed before applying heat. This includes all label plates, brackets, clips, etc. b. [[Scraping tools used to remove blistered paint must be kept sharp to be effective]]. Do all scraping in the direction of the wood grain to prevent shredding of wood fibers and gouging of the bare wood surface. This phase of paint removal is important in preparing the surface for sanding. c. All areas stripped as previously described are now ready for sanding before priming. Hand sanding, with wooden blocks where practicable, using the correct grit paper, is the prescribed final step. Careful dusting before paint application is absolutely necessary to achieve a good primer bond, or bond between subsequent paint coats.
