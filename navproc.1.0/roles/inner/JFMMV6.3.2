This initial data entry may be done in pencil to prevent unnecessary line outs until the charge review process is complete. (1) Pilot Cell Numbers - enter, in the space provided at the top of each page, the current pilot cell numbers. If the pilot cell(s) are changed, draw a single line through the old pilot cell number(s) and write in the new pilot cell number(s). The change need only be made on the page in which the pilot cell(s) are Changed. (2) Date - enter the date entered on the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6). This should reflect the date in which the charge was begun. (3) Type of charge - enter the code that reflects the type of charge conducted. These codes apply: N = Normal charge E = Equalizing charge P = Partial charge EE = Extended or non-tapering charge (4) Charge number - enter the charge numbers in sequential order. Charge numbering begins with the first on board charge. (5) SG and temperature-pilot cells - the data to be entered in this section should match the data entered in the “Specific Gravity Data” block in the lower right hand corner of the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6). As noted at the top of each page of this section, all SG entries must be the temperature Corrected values (height corrections are not used for the current batteries).

This initial data entry may be done in pencil to prevent unnecessary line outs until the charge review process is complete. (1) Pilot Cell Numbers - enter, in the space provided at the top of each page, the current pilot cell numbers. If the pilot cell(s) are changed, draw a single line through the old pilot cell number(s) and write in the new pilot cell number(s). The change need only be made on the page in which the pilot cell(s) are Changed. (2) Date - enter the date entered on the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6). This should reflect the date in which the charge was begun. (3) Type of charge - enter the code that reflects the type of charge conducted. These codes apply: N = Normal charge E = Equalizing charge P = Partial charge EE = Extended or non-tapering charge (4) Charge number - enter the charge numbers in sequential order. Charge numbering begins with the first on board charge. (5) SG and temperature-pilot cells - the data to be entered in this section should match the data entered in the “Specific Gravity Data” block in the lower right hand corner of the Submarine Battery Log (NAVSEA 9320/6). As noted at the top of each page of this section, all SG entries must be the temperature Corrected values (height corrections are not used for the current batteries). Before change and after change number - enter the pilot cell number for the data to be entered in that column. As previously noted, [[enter]] the pilot cells in an ascending order, with the lowest numbered pilot cell listed first.
