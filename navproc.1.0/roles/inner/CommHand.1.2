U.S. Navy policy requires warships to assert the rights of sovereign immunity. 2.2.3 Crew Lists and Inspections U.S. policy prohibits providing a list of crew members (to include military and nonmilitary personnel) or any other passengers on board a USS or USCGC vessel as a condition of entry into a port or to satisfy local immigration officials upon arrival. For more information concerning U.S. policy in this regard see CNO WASHINGTON, DC 071719Z JUL 16 (NAVADMIN 158/16). It is U.S. policy to refuse host government requests to conduct inspections of U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels, conduct health inspections of crew members, provide specific information on individual crew members (including providing access to a crew member’s medical record or the completion of an individual health questionnaire), or undertake other requested actions beyond the commanding officer’s certification.
