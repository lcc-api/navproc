Routine and Pre-Availability Inspections. (1) Once during the unit’s cycle, not to exceed 24 months. The normal interval between routine diesel inspections is 18 months. Routine and Pre-Availability Inspections may be performed as early as 12 months or as late as 24 months to allow for maximum scheduling flexibility and utilization of assessment findings. The TYCOM, Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) and other Fleet Maintenance Managers must ensure the Routine and Pre-Availability Inspection is scheduled to allow adequate time prior to availabilities to utilize the inspection and assessment results to plan work on the diesel. As per reference (a), in no case must the interval between Routine Inspections exceed 24 months. A Routine or Pre-Availability Inspection normally consists of all three phases as discussed in paragraph 4.3.4 of this chapter. For Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) onboard nuclear powered vessels, industrial activity work on the diesel engine(s) or its support systems will not normally be approved except during a Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Availability. The TYCOM or ISIC must ensure that adequate upkeep time is made available prior to the availability to ensure there are a sufficient number of diesel engines with no outstanding discrepancies to provide the required standby power during the availability. (2) For Submarine CNO Availabilities greater than six months. (a) The Pre-Availability Inspection must be integrated into the Shipyard’s work definition period and must be considered the material health assessment for the EDG. (b) SUBMEPP must enter this Pre-Availability Inspection in the applicable 000-Series SWLIN as a material health assessment assigned to Forces Afloat. (c) The DEI must include the Executing Shipyard (Code 260) and the Supervisor of Shipbuilding or NAVSEA Shipyard Representative’s Office, as applicable, on distribution for all DEI reports conducted as a Pre-Availability Inspection or during the availability. (d) As Lead Maintenance Activity, the executing shipyard will work with the TYCOM to assign all deferred inspection deficiencies to the appropriate repair activity for repair. (e) The Shipyard’s technical review of this inspection report may satisfy the Pre-Availability technical assessment requirement of reference (c). b. Post Casualty or Pre-Overhaul. When major internal engine malfunctions have occurred or are suspected (e.g., crankcase explosion, major bearing, blower or crankshaft failure), or there are indications that the engine is in need for overhaul. Extent of disassembly or inspection is at the discretion of the DEI based on the casualty or observed indications. For Post Casualty Inspections, the DEI must determine the full extent of damage and the cause, along with recommendations for repairs. For Pre-Overhaul Inspections, the TYCOM may require the DEI confirm that an overhaul is required and determine the scope of the overhaul. Partial inspections do not satisfy the requirement for a complete Routine Inspection and this fact will be annotated in the DEI’s written report. c. Post Overhaul or Repair. When an engine has been overhauled or significant maintenance or repair has been completed. A Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection must be conducted by a DEI prior to continuous operation. The DEI will make the final determination of whether the overhaul or repair was extensive enough to warrant a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection. The inspection must consist of a review of actions taken to complete the overhaul or repair, external visual inspection, tests of safety devices, review of required readings or clearances and a Phase III operational test. Unless there are indications of internal discrepancies, Phase II (internal inspection) is waived and the Routine Inspection periodicity requirement in paragraph 4.3.2.a of this chapter will be considered complete and valid. The Post Overhaul or Repair inspection should be an integral part of the overhaul or repair vice a separate inspection. Specifically, the Phase III operational test should be part of the final operational testing of the overhaul or repair vice a separate operational test. (1) For contractor accomplished work, the contractor specification will contain requirements for the contractor to document required readings or clearances on applicable forms and have appropriate check points made by a DEI or Industrial Subject Matter Expert (SME) during the overhaul or repair. If there is evidence of poor workmanship, use of improper parts, discrepancies in reassembly or test documentation or missing information as part of the repair process or during the inspection, the DEI or Industrial SME will advise the Repair Project Manager of the quality issues and required actions. The Repair Project Manager will coordinate required actions with the RMC Technical Authority and Maintenance Team. The RMC must liaise with the TYCOM and obtain TYCOM concurrence on all required actions and must advise the TYCOM of all potential cost and schedule impacts. (2) For Ship’s Force or Fleet Maintenance Activity accomplished engine overhauls, a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection will be conducted by a DEI prior to starting the engine. The scope of the inspection will be as specified in paragraph 4.3.2.c of this chapter. Commanding Officer (or designated representative) permission is required to perform Phase II (internal inspection) when requested by the DEI. d. New Construction (Acceptance Inspection). (1) Prior to the delivery of a newly constructed ship, when requested by the Board of Inspection and Survey. An acceptance inspection will normally be conducted in conjunction with the open-and-inspect phase of Board of Inspection Survey acceptance trials. The acceptance inspection does not satisfy the requirements of a routine inspection. (2) The initial Routine Inspection on a new construction unit must occur prior to initial startup by Ship’s Force. The cognizant Supervisor of Shipbuilding should incorporate the DEI as part of the Government Test Plan or Acceptance Plan. The cognizant Supervisor of Shipbuilding must notify the DEI for new construction acceptance test prior to Ship’s Force accepting responsibility of the diesel engine. This will ensure that an inspection baseline is established and construction discrepancies are identified and corrected early in the life of the unit. (3) For submarine and CVN construction programs, the initial Routine Inspection on a new construction unit must occur prior to initial startup by Ship’s Force. For ships with temporary systems in place or less than 95 percent load available, the Phase I (see paragraph 4.3.4a of this chapter) and Phase II (see paragraph 4.3.4b of this chapter) inspections must occur in conjunction with crew Operational Control Transfer including an operational test at available load. The Phase III (see paragraph 4.3.4c of this chapter) inspection must occur prior to ship delivery when sufficient loading is available. Any as found conditions requiring corrections must be adjudicated via the normal shipyard Operational Control Transfer inspections adjudication process. The routine diesel inspection periodicity must commence upon completion of all three diesel engine inspection phases. e. Reactivation of Engines in Inactive Equipment Maintenance.

The DEI will make the final determination of whether the overhaul or repair was extensive enough to warrant a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection. The inspection must consist of a review of actions taken to complete the overhaul or repair, external visual inspection, tests of safety devices, review of required readings or clearances and a Phase III operational test. Unless there are indications of internal discrepancies, Phase II (internal inspection) is waived and the Routine Inspection periodicity requirement in paragraph 4.3.2.a of this chapter will be considered complete and valid. The Post Overhaul or Repair inspection should be an integral part of the overhaul or repair vice a separate inspection. Specifically, the Phase III operational test should be part of the final operational testing of the overhaul or repair vice a separate operational test. (1) For contractor accomplished work, the contractor specification will contain requirements for the contractor to document required readings or clearances on applicable forms and have appropriate check points made by a DEI or Industrial Subject Matter Expert (SME) during the overhaul or repair. If there is evidence of poor workmanship, use of improper parts, discrepancies in reassembly or test documentation or missing information as part of the repair process or during the inspection, the DEI or Industrial SME will advise the Repair Project Manager of the quality issues and required actions. The Repair Project Manager will coordinate required actions with the RMC Technical Authority and Maintenance Team. The RMC must liaise with the TYCOM and obtain TYCOM concurrence on all required actions and must advise the TYCOM of all potential cost and schedule impacts. (2) For Ship’s Force or Fleet Maintenance Activity accomplished engine overhauls, a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection will be conducted by a DEI prior to starting the engine. The scope of the inspection will be as specified in paragraph 4.3.2.c of this chapter. Commanding Officer (or designated representative) permission is required to perform Phase II (internal inspection) when requested by the DEI. d. [[New Construction (Acceptance Inspection)]]. (1) Prior to the delivery of a newly constructed ship, when requested by the Board of Inspection and Survey. An acceptance inspection will normally be conducted in conjunction with the open-and-inspect phase of Board of Inspection Survey acceptance trials. The acceptance inspection does not satisfy the requirements of a routine inspection. (2) The initial Routine Inspection on a new construction unit must occur prior to initial startup by Ship’s Force. The cognizant Supervisor of Shipbuilding should incorporate the DEI as part of the Government Test Plan or Acceptance Plan. The cognizant Supervisor of Shipbuilding must notify the DEI for new construction acceptance test prior to Ship’s Force accepting responsibility of the diesel engine. This will ensure that an inspection baseline is established and construction discrepancies are identified and corrected early in the life of the unit. (3) For submarine and CVN construction programs, the initial Routine Inspection on a new construction unit must occur prior to initial startup by Ship’s Force. For ships with temporary systems in place or less than 95 percent load available, the Phase I (see paragraph 4.3.4a of this chapter) and Phase II (see paragraph 4.3.4b of this chapter) inspections must occur in conjunction with crew Operational Control Transfer including an operational test at available load. The Phase III (see paragraph 4.3.4c of this chapter) inspection must occur prior to ship delivery when sufficient loading is available. Any as found conditions requiring corrections must be adjudicated via the normal shipyard Operational Control Transfer inspections adjudication process. The routine diesel inspection periodicity must commence upon completion of all three diesel engine inspection phases. e. Reactivation of Engines in Inactive Equipment Maintenance.

Routine and Pre-Availability Inspections. (1) Once during the unit’s cycle, not to exceed 24 months. The normal interval between routine diesel inspections is 18 months. Routine and Pre-Availability Inspections may be performed as early as 12 months or as late as 24 months to allow for maximum scheduling flexibility and utilization of assessment findings. The TYCOM, Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) and other Fleet Maintenance Managers must ensure the Routine and Pre-Availability Inspection is scheduled to allow adequate time prior to availabilities to utilize the inspection and assessment results to plan work on the diesel. As per reference (a), in no case must the interval between Routine Inspections exceed 24 months. A Routine or Pre-Availability Inspection normally consists of all three phases as discussed in paragraph 4.3.4 of this chapter. For Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) onboard nuclear powered vessels, industrial activity work on the diesel engine(s) or its support systems will not normally be approved except during a Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Availability. The TYCOM or ISIC must ensure that adequate upkeep time is made available prior to the availability to ensure there are a sufficient number of diesel engines with no outstanding discrepancies to provide the required standby power during the availability. (2) For Submarine CNO Availabilities greater than six months. (a) The Pre-Availability Inspection must be integrated into the Shipyard’s work definition period and must be considered the material health assessment for the EDG. (b) SUBMEPP must enter this Pre-Availability Inspection in the applicable 000-Series SWLIN as a material health assessment assigned to Forces Afloat. (c) The DEI must include the Executing Shipyard (Code 260) and the Supervisor of Shipbuilding or NAVSEA Shipyard Representative’s Office, as applicable, on distribution for all DEI reports conducted as a Pre-Availability Inspection or during the availability. (d) As Lead Maintenance Activity, the executing shipyard will work with the TYCOM to assign all deferred inspection deficiencies to the appropriate repair activity for repair. (e) The Shipyard’s technical review of this inspection report may satisfy the Pre-Availability technical assessment requirement of reference (c). b. Post Casualty or Pre-Overhaul. When major internal engine malfunctions have occurred or are suspected (e.g., crankcase explosion, major bearing, blower or crankshaft failure), or there are indications that the engine is in need for overhaul. Extent of disassembly or inspection is at the discretion of the DEI based on the casualty or observed indications. For Post Casualty Inspections, the DEI must determine the full extent of damage and the cause, along with recommendations for repairs. For Pre-Overhaul Inspections, the TYCOM may require the DEI confirm that an overhaul is required and determine the scope of the overhaul. Partial inspections do not satisfy the requirement for a complete Routine Inspection and this fact will be annotated in the DEI’s written report. c. Post Overhaul or Repair. When an engine has been overhauled or significant maintenance or repair has been completed. A Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection must be conducted by a DEI prior to continuous operation. The DEI will make the final determination of whether the overhaul or repair was extensive enough to warrant a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection. The inspection must consist of a review of actions taken to complete the overhaul or repair, external visual inspection, tests of safety devices, review of required readings or clearances and a Phase III operational test. Unless there are indications of internal discrepancies, Phase II (internal inspection) is waived and the Routine Inspection periodicity requirement in paragraph 4.3.2.a of this chapter will be considered complete and valid.

The Repair Project Manager will coordinate required actions with the RMC Technical Authority and Maintenance Team. The RMC must liaise with the TYCOM and obtain TYCOM concurrence on all required actions and must advise the TYCOM of all potential cost and schedule impacts. (2) For Ship’s Force or Fleet Maintenance Activity accomplished engine overhauls, a Post Overhaul or Repair Inspection will be conducted by a DEI prior to starting the engine. The scope of the inspection will be as specified in paragraph 4.3.2.c of this chapter. Commanding Officer (or designated representative) permission is required to perform Phase II (internal inspection) when requested by the DEI. d. New Construction (Acceptance Inspection). (1) Prior to the delivery of a newly constructed ship, when requested by the Board of Inspection and Survey. An acceptance inspection will normally be conducted in conjunction with the open-and-inspect phase of Board of Inspection Survey acceptance trials. The acceptance inspection does not satisfy the requirements of a routine inspection. (2) The initial Routine Inspection on a new construction unit must occur prior to initial startup by Ship’s Force.
