Ejection Seat Training (EST). (1) The training shall include but is not limited to the following topics: canopy system (preflight checks, internal/external activation), ejection seat preflight checks IAW T/M/S NFM, strapping in (e.g., proper leg Restraint placement, as applicable), ejection decision, ejection envelope, optimal body position, ejection initiation, ejection sequences/phases/modes, Drogue/stabilization, main parachute deployment altitudes, seat/man separation, IROK/ADR, malfunctions (back-up and manual overrides methods), and hazards (flash burn, cockpit missile hazards/loose gear, poor body position, excessively heavy or light body weight, wind blast, ALSS fit, landing in winds in excess of 25 knots), and ground emergency egress (with/without seat kit). Unless operationally unfeasible, an NAP, AMSO, or FS shall address the aeromedical aspects of ejection and ground egress. The transition training shall concentrate on the differences in the system (i.e., ejection decisions, the envelope of the new system, seat–man separation, ejection initiation, ejection Sequence, normal operations and malfunctions). (2) EST−NVD — Aviators, aircrew and selected passengers flying with NVDs in ejection seat aircraft require additional egress training. Failure to remove NVDs prior to ejection may result in serious injury or death. NVD removal training shall be incorporated into initial training and annual ejection seat/egress training. This training will include actual drills on removal of NVDs prior to ejection. The pilot in command of any NVD flight shall ensure that non-NVD qualified personnel are thoroughly briefed and shall demonstrate proper technique of removing NVDs for ejection situations. Documentation of annual or transition ejection seat training with NVDs shall be entered into the individual’s NATOPS Training/Qualification Jacket (Opnav 3760/32). b. EET Egress Emergency Egress Training — Training can be conducted by squadron personnel who are most familiar with egress procedures and devices. Unless operationally unfeasible, an NAP, AMSO, or FS shall address the aeromedical aspects of egress and survival considerations. Specific T/M/S training shall be accomplished and documented prior to flights in that aircraft. Specific training shall be conducted for flight personnel with regard to assisting passengers and non-essential aircrew. c. SDO/IGS Sensory Problems/Spatial Disorientation Training – Spatial disorientation, visual illusions, visual scanning, situational awareness (including low level flights issues) and disorientation countermeasures. This training will be specific to both the aircraft T/M/S and the environment in which it is flown. The following topics shall be covered at a minimum; spatial disorientation/misorientation, visual illusions, visual scanning, situational awareness, and disorientation countermeasures. Unless operationally unfeasible, an NAP, AMSO or FS shall conduct this training. d. LEP Laser/Laser Eye Protection (LEP). Laser Hazards, Operations and Safety/Laser Eye Protection for Class 3a lasers and above for operators/maintainers per reference (bc). This training will be specific to both the aircraft T/M/S and the environment in which it is flown. e. DHT Hypoxia Awareness Training (Class 1 aircraft only) — This training will be specific to both the aircraft T/M/S and the environment in which it is flown. The following topics shall be covered at a minimum; types of hypoxia, signs, symptoms, situations which could lead to hypoxia, treatment, and countermeasures. Where available, dynamic hypoxia training with a ROBD is encouraged. Unless operationally unfeasible, an NAP, AMSO or FS shall conduct this training. Training may be accomplished as lecture only or by AMSO or NASTP provided Dynamic Hypoxia Training using a ROBD. f. GTIP G-Tolerance Improvement Program (G-TIP) (as applicable). This brief should cover anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM), push/ pull phenomenon, G-suit fit, hydration, nutrition, fatigue, and exercises that will promote an increase in G tolerance. g. ALSS ALSS items – Platform specific survival items contained in the vest, seat kit and/or aircraft mounted kits. Survival radio training briefs shall be given by an AMSO, AMSC, or an aircrew subject matter expert. The training shall be documented on the OPNAV 3760/32F. The 4−year NASTP training does NOT meet the requirements of this section except in the case of the PRC−149 radio. h. All aircrew shall receive a squadron applicable survival radio brief prior to their first flight with the squadron. If an aircrew member has previously documented training on the radio in the past year, this requirement does not apply. In addition, all aircrew should receive a squadron applicable aviation survival radio training brief annually. i. Within 90 days of deployment all aircrew shall receive a brief for all survival radios they will be using during deployment. The brief should cover all functions of the radio system and include a practical application.
