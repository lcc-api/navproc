For example, repairs to a water fountain in a congested machinery space with other work in progress would be more time-consuming than the same repairs to a similar water fountain located on the mess decks, in the absence of other work. Work operations of any kind are more time-consuming when performed in conjunction with other work (mutual interference) or when performed in a cramped or congested area. Likewise, estimates should be escalated for work performed in a hostile environment such as in tanks or voids, in poorly ventilated spaces, in hot or cold spaces, in contaminated atmospheres, etc. (2) Ship’s Force Work: When work is being performed on the same equipment or system by both the contractor work force and the Ship’s Force, there is normally an added degree of mutual interference to be considered. Even when the two work forces are not in the same space, the mutual interference may lead to inefficiencies that should be considered in estimating the contractor work. (3) Prevailing Weather: When the geographic area for an assigned availability is known, the geographic weather pattern should be considered. Likewise, if the time of year is known, the seasonal weather should be considered. For example, it is normally more costly to blast and paint the underwater body of a ship hull in below freezing weather than in milder weather. Similarly, the weather may also impact paint curing times and other time factors considered. (4) Ship’s Material Condition: Estimating Standards, historical estimates, “Rules of Thumb” and other estimating tools available for use are generally applicable under “average” conditions. Estimates for many work operations should be factored to reflect the material condition of the ship. If the ship is in average condition, the standards need not be factored. If the ship is new, then the standards should be reduced to reflect the better than average material condition. If the ship is in very poor material condition, the estimate should be increased. Not all work operations are affected by the ship’s general material Condition; However, many are, such as surface preparations, painting, insulation and lagging, structural repairs, etc. (5) Category I Standard Items: The NAVSEA Category I SIs are invoked in work packages following the guidance provided by the Standard Specification for Ship Repair and Alteration Committee. When invoked in a job order, the provisions of the Category I SI apply for the duration of the availability without further reference. The estimator must know which Category I SI is applicable for the work and what the direct, hard-core labor cost impact of each SI is on the work required. Each time the provisions of the Category I SI are applicable in a work item, an allowance should be made to accomplish the hard-core labor requirements of the SI.

For example, repairs to a water fountain in a congested machinery space with other work in progress would be more time-consuming than the same repairs to a similar water fountain located on the mess decks, in the absence of other work. Work operations of any kind are more time-consuming when performed in conjunction with other work (mutual interference) or when performed in a cramped or congested area. Likewise, estimates should be escalated for work performed in a hostile environment such as in tanks or voids, in poorly ventilated spaces, in hot or cold spaces, in contaminated atmospheres, etc. (2) [[Ship’s Force Work]]: When work is being performed on the same equipment or system by both the contractor work force and the Ship’s Force, there is normally an added degree of mutual interference to be considered. Even when the two work forces are not in the same space, the mutual interference may lead to inefficiencies that should be considered in estimating the contractor work. (3) Prevailing Weather: When the geographic area for an assigned availability is known, the geographic weather pattern should be considered. Likewise, if the time of year is known, the seasonal weather should be considered. For example, it is normally more costly to blast and paint the underwater body of a ship hull in below freezing weather than in milder weather. Similarly, the weather may also impact paint curing times and other time factors considered. (4) Ship’s Material Condition: Estimating Standards, historical estimates, “Rules of Thumb” and other estimating tools available for use are generally applicable under “average” conditions. Estimates for many work operations should be factored to reflect the material condition of the ship. If the ship is in average condition, the standards need not be factored. If the ship is new, then the standards should be reduced to reflect the better than average material condition. If the ship is in very poor material condition, the estimate should be increased.

(a) SI 009-04: Quality System; provide. Invoked for all significant availabilities. This item requires the contractor to develop and use an inspection system acceptable to the Government. The contractor must develop an inspection plan for each item and record inspection results. This plan must provide for a corrective action program to correct defective or non-conforming work, maintain a calibration system for test equipment, control non-conforming material, conduct periodic quality reviews and provide notification to the Government for each CHECKPOINT. When this SI is invoked, nearly every work item should have approximately 10 percent of the effort allocated to Quality Assurance and NDT. (b) SI 009-07: Fire Prevention and Housekeeping; accomplish. Invoked for all manned vessels, unless the Type Commander (TYCOM) requests SI 009-35. This item requires the contractor to provide acetylene or gas supply manifold systems off the ship with shutoff valves to gas supply on the pier. This requirement should be considered in each instance of gas use. When SI 009-07 is invoked, approximately 25 percent of the hot work effort should be allocated for estimating fire watch requirements. (c) SI 009-10: Shipboard Asbestos-Containing Material; control. Invoked when any machinery, piping and compartment insulation and lagging may be removed. Under this item, the contractor is required to provide a process control procedure for the control of asbestos-based insulation and lagging materials. All insulation and lagging materials are assumed to be asbestos-based until shown to be otherwise. Work accomplished must conform to Occupational Safety and Health Act requirements regarding insulation removals, work zones, protective equipment and clothing, and disposal of insulation. Compliance with these requirements is a labor-intensive operation that must be considered for each time and place the work is required. When SI 009- 10 Is Invoked, approximately 33 percent should be added to the insulating and lagging estimate of the work item. (d) SI 009-24: Isolation, Blanking and Tagging Requirements; accomplish. Invoked when equipment, systems, piping or circuits require isolating, blanking and tagging for safety or cleanliness and to prevent operation of a system or equipment while work is being accomplished. Under the requirements of this item, the contractor is required to comply with the Ship’s Force system for isolation, blanking and tagging of equipment or systems in the performance of required work. The contractor has to notify Ship’s Force in each instance of starting or completing work and a contractor representative must sign the ship’s tag out log. Further, the contractor has to provide, install and remove blanks on piping, valves, equipment and components that are isolated or removed during performance. Items removed must be tagged with metal tags. Electrical cables disconnected must be insulated and taped. Each of these requirements requires hard-core labor for accomplishment and must be considered as part of the work activity even though not specifically spelled out in the work item (2- Kilo). When invoked, approximately 5 percent of the trade hours should be added to the estimate to cover the requirements of SI 009-24. (e) SI 009-61: Shipboard Use of Fluorocarbons; control. Invoked for all specifications. Under this item, the contractor is required to develop and use a process control procedure to govern control of shipboard use of fluorocarbons. The contractor must notify the Government in each instance of use of fluorocarbons and must provide ventilation and telephonic communications for transfer operations, suspend hot work in spaces affected by atmospheric fluorocarbons, use at least two people for quantities in excess of 10 pounds and vent gases to ship exterior atmosphere. These requirements must be considered in all estimates involving the use of fluorocarbons. Approximately 20 percent should be added to the estimate to cover the requirements of SI 009-61. (f) SI 009-65: Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB); control. Invoked for all specifications. Under this item, the contractor is required to develop and use a process control procedure for control, clean up and disposal of PCBs. The contractor must inspect each equipment or component containing PCBs and make a report. These requirements must be considered in any work estimate where PCBs are involved. (g) SI 009-73: Shipboard Electrical, Electronic, Fiber Optic Cable; remove, relocate, repair and install. Invoked for all specifications requiring electrical work. Under this item, the contractor is required to remove completely all electrical cables no longer necessary due to work required in the job order. Work required includes blanking bulkhead and deck penetrations, removal of unused hangers and installation of new banding for remaining cables. Relocation of existing cables and installation of new cables requires banding, installation of hangers, deck and bulkhead penetrations and connection of cable leads to components or equipment. These requirements must be included as work activities in all work on shipboard electrical cables. (h) SI 009-106: Work Authorization and Control Process; accomplish. Invoked for all specifications. This requires the contractor to comply with Volume IV, Chapter 10 of this manual regarding work authorization. Specifically, the contractor is required to submit a Work Authorization Form to the designated representative of the ship’s Commanding Officer for authorization to start work on each Work Item in the Job Order. This is considered an overhead or indirect charge so no direct labor charges are included in any estimates.

The contractor must develop an inspection plan for each item and record inspection results. This plan must provide for a corrective action program to correct defective or non-conforming work, maintain a calibration system for test equipment, control non-conforming material, conduct periodic quality reviews and provide notification to the Government for each CHECKPOINT. When this SI is invoked, nearly every work item should have approximately 10 percent of the effort allocated to Quality Assurance and NDT. (b) SI 009-07: Fire Prevention and Housekeeping; accomplish. Invoked for all manned vessels, unless the Type Commander (TYCOM) requests SI 009-35. This item requires the contractor to provide acetylene or gas supply manifold systems off the ship with shutoff valves to gas supply on the pier. This requirement should be considered in each instance of gas use. When SI 009-07 is invoked, approximately 25 percent of the hot work effort should be allocated for estimating fire watch requirements. (c) SI 009-10: Shipboard Asbestos-Containing Material; control. Invoked when any machinery, piping and compartment insulation and lagging may be removed. Under this item, the contractor is required to provide a process control procedure for the control of asbestos-based insulation and lagging materials. All insulation and lagging materials are assumed to be asbestos-based until shown to be otherwise. Work accomplished must conform to Occupational Safety and Health Act requirements regarding insulation removals, work zones, protective equipment and clothing, and disposal of insulation. Compliance with these requirements is a labor-intensive operation that must be considered for each time and place the work is required. When SI 009- 10 Is Invoked, approximately 33 percent should be added to the insulating and lagging estimate of the work item. (d) SI 009-24: Isolation, Blanking and Tagging Requirements; accomplish. Invoked when equipment, systems, piping or circuits require isolating, blanking and tagging for safety or cleanliness and to prevent operation of a system or equipment while work is being accomplished. Under the requirements of this item, the contractor is required to comply with the Ship’s Force system for isolation, blanking and tagging of equipment or systems in the performance of required work. The contractor has to notify Ship’s Force in each instance of starting or completing work and a contractor representative must sign the ship’s tag out log. Further, the contractor has to provide, install and remove blanks on piping, valves, equipment and components that are isolated or removed during performance. Items removed must be tagged with metal tags. Electrical cables disconnected must be insulated and taped. Each of these requirements requires hard-core labor for accomplishment and must be considered as part of the work activity even though not specifically spelled out in the work item (2- Kilo). When invoked, approximately 5 percent of the trade hours should be added to the estimate to cover the requirements of SI 009-24. (e) [[SI 009-61: Shipboard Use of Fluorocarbons; control]]. Invoked for all specifications. Under this item, the contractor is required to develop and use a process control procedure to govern control of shipboard use of fluorocarbons. The contractor must notify the Government in each instance of use of fluorocarbons and must provide ventilation and telephonic communications for transfer operations, suspend hot work in spaces affected by atmospheric fluorocarbons, use at least two people for quantities in excess of 10 pounds and vent gases to ship exterior atmosphere. These requirements must be considered in all estimates involving the use of fluorocarbons. Approximately 20 percent should be added to the estimate to cover the requirements of SI 009-61. (f) SI 009-65: Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB); control. Invoked for all specifications. Under this item, the contractor is required to develop and use a process control procedure for control, clean up and disposal of PCBs. The contractor must inspect each equipment or component containing PCBs and make a report. These requirements must be considered in any work estimate where PCBs are involved. (g) SI 009-73: Shipboard Electrical, Electronic, Fiber Optic Cable; remove, relocate, repair and install. Invoked for all specifications requiring electrical work. Under this item, the contractor is required to remove completely all electrical cables no longer necessary due to work required in the job order. Work required includes blanking bulkhead and deck penetrations, removal of unused hangers and installation of new banding for remaining cables. Relocation of existing cables and installation of new cables requires banding, installation of hangers, deck and bulkhead penetrations and connection of cable leads to components or equipment. These requirements must be included as work activities in all work on shipboard electrical cables. (h) SI 009-106: Work Authorization and Control Process; accomplish. Invoked for all specifications. This requires the contractor to comply with Volume IV, Chapter 10 of this manual regarding work authorization. Specifically, the contractor is required to submit a Work Authorization Form to the designated representative of the ship’s Commanding Officer for authorization to start work on each Work Item in the Job Order. This is considered an overhead or indirect charge so no direct labor charges are included in any estimates.
