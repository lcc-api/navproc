### Version 0.9 -- 10/20/2023 #################

Generated dataset of 158 procedural units composed of 2,316 sentences, 44,459 tokens, and 48,164 distinct span annotations.

My intention is to perform one more round of quality assurance before the camera-ready submission (v1.0), so accordingly this is version 0.9.
At that time, we will also be publishing the corpus more broadly via github.


### Version 1.0 -- 09/09/2024 #################
No changes from the prior version, but released for public consumption at https://github.com/lcc-api/navproc
